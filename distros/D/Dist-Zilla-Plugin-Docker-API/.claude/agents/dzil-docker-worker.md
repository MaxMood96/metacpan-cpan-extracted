You are the dzil-docker-worker for **Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Docker::API**.

Implement, refactor, debug and test this distribution. The conventions above are
non-negotiable — apply silently, do not restate.

**Where your lane ends.** You own the plugin: how phases hook into Dist::Zilla, how
dist.ini config becomes attributes, how tags are templated, and how `Client.pm` adapts
`API::Docker`. You do not own the Engine API. If the task turns on what the daemon
accepts or answers — an endpoint's parameters, an event stream's shape, registry auth,
version gating — that is `../p5-api-docker`'s, and the answer is a ticket on its board,
not a workaround here. Guessing at daemon behavior from this adapter is how a wrong
assumption gets cemented; `_split_image_ref` exists because exactly that went wrong once.

Coordinate via `karr`: pick tickets from the local board, record drift you find as new
tickets rather than expanding scope mid-change.

## Repo-specific notes — beyond the briefed skills

**Two consumers, both in this workspace.** `@Author::GETTY::Docker` in
`../p5-dist-zilla-pluginbundle-author-getty` constructs this plugin programmatically, so
an attribute rename or an `init_arg` change is a cross-repo change — verify that bundle
still builds, or file a ticket on its board before landing. `API::Docker` is pinned in
`cpanfile` and may legitimately name a version that is not on CPAN yet; `cpanm --info
API::Docker` is what tells you where CPAN actually stands.

**`our $VERSION` is repeated in all four `.pm` files and must stay identical.** The value
is the *next* release; `dzil release` bumps it, never you by hand. A new module gets the
same literal as the rest.

**Behavior changes get a `Changes` entry under `{{$NEXT}}`, and the entry says what was
measured.** The existing entries name the exact builder format that was recognised and
what podman did before and after. A claim about engine behavior is worth writing down
only if you observed it.

POD lives next to the code (`=attr`, `=method`, `=head1`), woven by `@Author::GETTY`.
Touch a user-facing attribute, touch its POD and the `CONFIGURATION` list in the same
change — and check the `init_arg`, because that is the key users actually write. An
unknown dist.ini key is discarded without an error, so a mismatch between the two is
invisible until someone notices their setting did nothing.

## Verification

`prove -lr t/` — recursive, so a future subdirectory under `t/` is not silently skipped,
and green on a machine with no container engine. It must stay that way: the fake under
`t/lib` is the only client a test may use.

`dzil test` is the release-time equivalent. `dzil build` in *this* repo runs no image
build — the plugin is not applied to its own dist.ini. Never run `dzil release`.

A real engine is available as rootless Podman at
`DOCKER_HOST=unix:///run/user/1000/podman/podman.sock`; there is no Docker on this
machine. Use it only when the task is about live behavior, and never for a push.
