DBD::PgAsync
------------

This is a fork of DBD::Pg (3.18.0) with more complete support for the
libq asynchronous interface. It supports an asynchronus mode for
database handles which can be enabled by setting the attribute
pg_use_async to true, either by passing it as attribute to connect or
setting it at a later time. When in asynchronous mode, the following
operations will use asynchronous interfaces by default:

	- connecting to a database server

	- preparing statements

	- executing statements via ->do or ->execute

	- transaction creation and initialization when AutoCommit is
          off 

	- the commit and rollback methods for ending a transaction

	- the ping and pg_ping methods

	- the savepoint methods

	- automatic deallocation of prepared statements

In contrast to this, DBD::Pg supports asynchronous mode only for do
and execute and will even then use 'hidden' synchronous queries for
transaction creation and initialization and prepared statement
deallocation.

Bug reports etc specifically about this code should probably rather be
sent to me than to any other DBD::Pg address, especially including the
principal author of most of the code (<greg@turnstep.com>). As a
development project, I consider this completed.

Debian Package
--------------

Because development happens on Debian (Devuan, actually, but that's an
unimportant detail), there's support for creating a Debian package of
the driver. This has only been tested Devuan daedalus (Debian 12
based) and the only tested way to build the package is executing

fakeroot debian/rules binary

in the top-level distribution directory.
