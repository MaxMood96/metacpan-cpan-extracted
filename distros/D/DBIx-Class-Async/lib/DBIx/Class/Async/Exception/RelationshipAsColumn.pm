=head1 NAME

DBIx::Class::Async::Exception::RelationshipAsColumn - Exception for relationship
name passed where a column was expected

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.63

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use DBIx::Class::Async::Exception::RelationshipAsColumn;

    DBIx::Class::Async::Exception::RelationshipAsColumn->throw(
        message           => "[DBIx::Class::Async] Relationship 'Details' passed where a column was expected",
        relationship      => 'Details',
        relationship_type => 'multi',
        source_class      => 'My::Schema::Result::Operation',
        operation         => 'update_or_create',
        hint              => "Omit 'Details' from the hashref if you have no related rows to insert.",
        original_error    => $raw_dbic_error,
    );

    # Catch specifically
    use Try::Tiny;
    try { ... } catch {
        if ( ref $_ && $_->isa('DBIx::Class::Async::Exception::RelationshipAsColumn') ) {
            warn sprintf "Relationship '%s' (type: %s) was passed as a column.\n%s\n",
                $_->relationship, $_->relationship_type, $_->hint;
        }
    };

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Thrown when a C<has_many>, C<belongs_to>, or C<might_have> relationship name is
used as a key in a create/update hashref with an C<undef> value, causing
L<DBIx::Class> to die internally with "No such column". This corresponds to
L<https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=127065|RT#127065>.

Inherits all methods from L<DBIx::Class::Async::Exception> and adds
L</relationship> and L</relationship_type>.

=cut

sub new {
    my ($class, %args) = @_;
    my $self = $class->SUPER::new(%args);
    $self->{relationship}      = $args{relationship};
    $self->{relationship_type} = $args{relationship_type} // 'relationship';
    return $self;
}

=head1 METHODS

Inherits C<throw>, C<rethrow>, C<message>, C<hint>, C<original_error>,
C<operation>, C<source_class>, and C<stacktrace> from
L<DBIx::Class::Async::Exception>.

=head2 relationship

    my $name = $exception->relationship;

The name of the relationship that was incorrectly passed as a column key,
e.g. C<'Details'>.

=cut

sub relationship      { $_[0]->{relationship}      }

=head2 relationship_type

    my $type = $exception->relationship_type;

The relationship accessor type, e.g. C<'multi'> (has_many), C<'single'>
(might_have / belongs_to), or C<'filter'>. Defaults to C<'relationship'> when
the type cannot be determined.

sub relationship_type { $_[0]->{relationship_type} }
