=head1 NAME

DB::Object::SQLite::Statement - SQLite Statement Object

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use DB::Object::SQLite::Statement;
    my $this = DB::Object::SQLite::Statement->new || die( DB::Object::SQLite::Statement->error, "\n" );

=head1 VERSION

    v0.300.1

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a SQLite specific statement object class.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 distinct

Provided with an optional column and called upon a C<SELECT> query and this will modify the query to add the keyword C<DISTINCT>

    $sth->distinct;
    # produces SELECT DISTINCT....
    $sth->distinct( 'name' );
    # produces SELECT DISTINCT ON (name)....

See L<SQLite documentation for more information|https://sqlite.org/lang_select.html>

=head2 dump

This is inherited from L<DB::Object::Statement/dump>

=head2 ignore

This takes no argument and this will modify the queries of type C<insert>, or C<update> to add the keyword C<IGNORE>

    $sth->ignore;
    # produces INSERT IGNORE....

If called in void context, this will execute the prepare statement handler immediately.

It returns the newly created statement handler.

See L<SQLite documentation for more information|https://www.sqlite.org/lang_insert.html>

=head2 only

This returns an error as C<SELECT FROM ONLY> is not supported by SQLite and will return an error.

=head2 priority

This is unsupported under SQLite and if used returns an error.

=head2 unprepared_statements

This returns the natural SQLite statement property C<sqlite_unprepared_statements>, which provides the remaining unprepared statements in case where multiple statements were prepared.

See L<DBD::SQLite documentation for more information|DBD::SQLite>

=head2 wait

This is unsupported under SQLite and it will be silently ignore, returning the current object.
