0.72 2015-08-29T21:51:19Z

     - The random seed was based on time of day and was a bit too predictable.

0.71 2008-09-16T15:38:06Z

     - Used $ARGV[0] rather than shift in Makefile.PL.  Thanks to John Fong for
       the correction.

0.70 2007-10-12T16:30:18Z

     - Minor corrections to POD.

0.69 2006-09-12T08:55:10Z

     - Changed pow to exp at randlib.c[1040] to get around a bug with gcc under
       AIX. (Would it also be possible to avoid this by using -lmsaa rather
       than -lm?)

0.68 2006-06-30T12:17:01Z

     - Added a new version of phrtsd and the phrtsd_orig option.

0.67 2003-03-14T13:57:16Z

     - Corrected an interface error in getsd and phrtsd.  Noted by Eric Moore.

0.66 2002-06-07T12:17:36Z

     - The test for random_multivariate_normal displayed an odd error message
       on some systems but not others.  This has been corrected.  The problem
       was noted by the CPAN-testers, Maynard Brandsma, and Nat Goodman.

0.65 2002-05-01T08:55:30Z

     - Add helper.h so that XS recognizes the return value of gvprfw().  Thanks
       to Stephan Heuel for noticing and correcting this problem.

0.64 2001-12-06T13:26:03Z

     - Rebuilt using h2xs 1.18 and a vanilla .xs file rather than a SWIG
       wrapper file.  This is more Perlish and will get around a reported
       problem with 'na' and 'sv_yes' in the wrapper.c file.

0.63 2001-09-05T09:31:04Z

     - Modified Makefile.PL to see whether Perl is using sv_yes or PL_sv_yes
       and adjust things automatically.

0.62 2001-08-22T09:30:14Z

     - In com.c and randlib.c, changed the Fortran-style labels and goto's in
       certain functions to proper {} blocks.  (For this I consulted the
       original L'Ecuyer/Cote paper.)
     - Changed all floats to doubles.
     - Increased the precision of many literals in accordance with the original
       papers (e.g. 1/M1 in ranf, log 4 in genbet, and so on).
     - Corrected one test in test.pl.

0.61 1999-05-19T07:55:53Z

     - Added a space to the translation table in phrtsd.
     - Cosmetic changes to bring this module into line with other Perl modules:
       added test.pl, Changes, MANIFEST, README; corrected some spelling, used
       "make dist", and so on.
     - Geoffrey Rommel
