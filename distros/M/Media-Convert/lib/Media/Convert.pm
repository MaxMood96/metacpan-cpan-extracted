=head1 DESCRIPTION

Media::Convert is a library that allows one to inspect and work
with (edit, convert, transcode) media files. Behind the scenes,
Media::Convert generates and runs ffmpeg/ffprobe command lines to
perform the requested operations.

Media::Convert was originally a part of the SReview web-based video
review and transcoding tool, but it was split off for being useful
enough in its own right.

Media::Convert uses semver as explained at L<https://semver.org>
