Revision history for Yote-SQLObjectStore

0.05  2026-02-23
    - Fixed table creation for modules referenced through *ARRAY_* and
      *HASH_* column types. generate_array_table and generate_hash_table
      were stripping the '*' prefix before calling generate_reference_table,
      preventing recursive table creation for referenced modules.
    - Fixed early return in generate_array_table and generate_hash_table
      when the shared table (ARRAY_REF, HASH_*_REF) already existed.
      The early return was skipping reference following, so only the first
      module referenced through a shared container table would get its
      table created.
    - Added t/table_generation.t with tests for recursive table creation
      through array and hash references.
