Revision history for Yote-Spiderpup

0.03  2026-02-22
    - Slot scoping: slot content now resolves variables from the parent scope
      where the component is used, not the slot-owning component's scope
    - Compiler generates regular functions instead of arrow functions, enabling
      proper scope rebinding via .call()
    - Fixed SSR rendering of slot content with correct parent variable scoping
    - Fixed hydrate() to support scope parameter, matching render() behavior
    - Fixed component parentModule to walk past RecipeConditional/RecipeLoop
      helpers, preventing TypeError when slot content is inside conditionals
    - Added store._notifyAll() for reactive update propagation
    - Added _containerEl to RecipeLoop and RecipeConditional
    - Cleanup of updatableElements/updatableRecipes in RecipeConditional.refresh()
