     * submit_recv asks for ONE read of up to len bytes into buf, delivered

     * and untouched until that completion arrives - the kernel writes into it
     * whenever it likes.
     *
     * `token` is opaque here on purpose. The core puts an fd-plus-generation
     * in it, because a completion can outlive the connection that asked for
     * it: the fd may be closed and REUSED before the kernel gets round to
     * it, and a bare fd would then deliver another connection's bytes to
     * whoever now holds that number.
     *
     * Returns 0 if submitted, -1 if not (the core falls back to reading).
     *
     * cancel_recv drops an in-flight read at close. It is best-effort: a
     * completion may already be on its way, which is what the generation in
