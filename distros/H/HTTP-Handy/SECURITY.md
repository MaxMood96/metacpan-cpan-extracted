# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in this distribution, please report
it by e-mail to the author at ina@cpan.org.

Do NOT open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.  Please use
private e-mail so that a fix can be prepared before public disclosure.

You can expect an acknowledgement within a few days.  If you do not receive
a response within one week, please follow up.

## Supported Versions

Only the most recent release on CPAN is actively maintained.  Please
upgrade to the latest version before reporting security issues.
