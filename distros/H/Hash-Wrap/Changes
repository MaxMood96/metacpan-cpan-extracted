Revision history for Hash-Wrap

1.07      2025-10-24 10:58:22-04:00 America/New_York

  [BUILD]

    * test for 1.06 fix failed under < Perl 5.18

1.06      2025-10-23 17:45:42-04:00 America/New_York

  [ENHANCEMENT]

    * version 1.05 introduced a bug  making hashes immutable if the
    -immutable attribute was specified, regardless of its value.

1.05      2025-10-19 22:22:19-04:00 America/New_York

  [ENHANCEMENT]

    * -immutable can take an arrayref of attributes, which will add
      any not defined to the object before it is locked.

1.04      2025-01-06 10:19:52-05:00 America/New_York

  [BUG FIX]

    * fix rt #156087: "Syntax error with perl < 5.18". ++srezic!

1.03      2024-05-09 15:25:05-04:00 America/New_York

  [BUG FIX]

    * incorrect value was returned first time an object at a lower
      level was returned for an immutable, recursive, copied wrapper.

1.02      2024-05-03 13:21:48-04:00 America/New_York

  [ENHANCEMENT]

    * new option '-into', allowing installation of the constructor in
      a package other than that of the caller's.

    * the '-class' option now prefers '-target' over '-caller',
      but still accepts the latter.

1.01      2024-03-01 10:48:51-05:00 America/New_York

  [TESTS]

    * fix tests to require same Perl version as module (5.10) rather
      than 5.18.

1.00      2024-02-29 16:28:02-05:00 America/New_York

  [BEHAVIOR CHANGE]

    * wrapping an object is an error. Previously hash *values* which
      were blessed hashes were not wrapped, but the actual passed hash
      reference was allowed to be a blesed hash.  This change makes
      the behavior consistent.

  [BUG FIX]

    * if the -copy attribute was set, recursively wrapped sub-hashes
      did not correctly update their parent hash to point at the copy
      of the sub-hash.

  [DOCUMENTATION]

    * describe interaction with input immutable hashes
    * document "eventually" immutable operation with -copy,-immutable
      on mutable hashes.

0.22      2022-02-09 11:53:27-05:00 America/New_York

    * correct version numbers in distributed code
    * no function changes

0.21      2022-02-09 11:53:27-05:00 America/New_York

  [BUG FIX]

    * remove draft code which shouldn't have gone into
      the release.


0.20      2022-02-09 11:53:27-05:00 America/New_York

  [BUG FIX]

    * -predicate option was totally broken. no tests. sigh.


0.19      2022-01-06 22:52:29-05:00 America/New_York

  [BUG FIX]

    * the can() method didn't acknowledge the existence of 'exists',
      'defined', or predicate methods.

    * recursively built constructors didn't use attributes passed to
      the top level constructor (like -exists, -defined, etc).


0.18      2021-08-11 16:17:38-04:00 America/New_York

  [ENHANCEMENT]

    * -predicate option provides has_foo style predicate methods.


0.17      2021-07-07 23:27:11-04:00 America/New_York

  [BUG FIX]

    * 0.16 broke -immutable
    * tests didn't distinguish between compile errors and actual errors.

0.16      2021-07-07 23:27:11-04:00 America/New_York

  [BUG FIX]

    * previous release broke custom cloning.


0.15      2021-07-07 23:27:11-04:00 America/New_York

  [ENHANCEMENT]

    * a reference to the constructor may now be stored in a user provided scalar
      via -as => \$scalar.  This avoids pollution of the caller's namespace.

    * recursive hash wrapping is now possible with -recurse, which specifies the
      recursion level limit

    * constructors may now be returned from the import() method via -as => -return.


0.14      2021-06-21 16:39:56-04:00 America/New_York

  [ENHANCEMENT]

    * methods can be added to the wrapping class via the -methods option.

  [BUILD]

    * use META.json instead of cpanfile as build-from-repo artifact

0.13      2021-04-01 15:45:07-04:00 America/New_York

  [ENHANCEMENT]

    * the -class option can take the value '-caller', which
      causes the class name to be determined from the calling
      package name and the constructor name.

0.12      2019-11-07 09:50:32-05:00 America/New_York

  [BUG FIX]

    * tests added in 0.11 were not backwards compatible with Perl < 5.18

0.11      2019-11-06 14:08:02-05:00 America/New_York

  [ENHANCEMENT]

    * new -immutable option, prevents adding keys or changing values.
    * new -lockkeys option, allows only specified keys in hash.


0.10      2019-09-25 13:59:31-04:00 America/New_York
  [BUG FIX]

    * can() produced erroneous and uncompileable code if it was called
      for an existing attribute which had not yet had an accessor
      created.

0.09      2019-06-20 16:57:19-04:00 America/New_York

  [ENHANCEMENT]

    * wrap_hash may now be called with no arguments, in which
      case it autogenerates a hash for you.


0.08      2018-02-27 10:57:06-05:00 America/New_York

  [API BREAKAGE]

    * Perl 5.10 is now the minimum version supported

    * the -create option is no longer available.  wrapper classes
      are always created.

    * modifying existing classes via -class is no longer supported
      as it proved too messy.

    * classes no longer subclass from Hash::Wrap::Base.

  [ENHANCEMENT]

    * stand alone wrapper classes are now possible via -base

    * wrapper classes can have real constructors via -new

    * documentation has been rewritten (again!)

    * wrapper classes can be subclassed

  [INTERNALS]

    * much code refactoring

    * accessor generation is now much simpler and subsequently faster.

    * construction of the wrapper classes is simplified (no more searching
      parent classes for validation and signature subroutinesbuilders), so
      mro::compat is not required.



0.07      2018-01-29 11:59:46-05:00 America/New_York

  [ENHANCEMENT]

    * exceptions are now thrown from the correct call frame

0.06      2018-01-29 11:59:46-05:00 America/New_York

  [ENHANCEMENT]

    * new options -exists and -undefined add exists() and defined()
      methods.

0.05      2018-01-29 11:59:46-05:00 America/New_York

  [BUILD FIX]

    * t/api.t was not completely updated for changes in version 0.04

0.04      2018-01-29 11:59:46-05:00 America/New_York

  [ENHANCEMENT]

    * it is now possible to create accessors which return undef
      (rather than throwing an exception) if a hash element does not
      exist.

    * The underlying code has gone through a significant rewrite.


0.03      2017-09-28 21:56:42-04:00 America/New_York

  [BUG FIX]

    * The default import of wrap_hash was broken by version 0.02.

0.02      2017-09-28 14:49:16-04:00 America/New_York

  [ENHANCEMENT]

    * lvalue accessors are now available for Perl 5.16 or later.

0.01      2017-09-25 11:50:04-04:00 America/New_York

    * Initial release upon an unsuspecting world
