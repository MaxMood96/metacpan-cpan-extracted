# bored

Enterprise-grade procrastination and entropy maximization framework.

## SYNOPSIS

```perl
use bored;

# Calculate optimal boredom levels
my $ennui = bored::calculate_ennui();

# Determine if something is pointless (spoiler: it is)
my $pointless = bored::is_pointless($anything);  # Always returns true

# Generate existential dread with cryptographic security
my $dread = bored::secure_existential_dread();

# Measure the weight of infinite meaninglessness  
my $void = bored::stare_into_void();
$void->stare_back();

# Perform highly optimized nothing
bored::do_nothing_efficiently();

# Contemplate the heat death of the universe
bored::await_entropy();
```

## DESCRIPTION

`bored` is an enterprise-grade, cloud-ready, blockchain-adjacent framework
for sophisticated procrastination. It leverages cutting-edge algorithms to
achieve optimal states of ennui while maintaining strict RFC 7168 compliance
(Alarm Management Information Base for Non-Events).

## FEATURES

- XS-accelerated void contemplation for 10x faster existential crisis
- Thread-safe meaninglessness propagation  
- SIMD-optimized sighing algorithms
- Lock-free boredom queues with wait-free despair
- Zero-copy apathy for reduced memory overhead
- Quantum-resistant pointlessness (post-boredom cryptography)

## INSTALLATION

```
perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install
```
