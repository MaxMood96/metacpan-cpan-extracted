=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module implements a class representing a temporary FASTA file where
sequence ids are automatically abbreviated (C<seq1>, C<seq2>...) for maximum
compatibility with external programs. To this end, it combines an internal
L<Bio::MUST::Core::Ali> object and a L<Bio::MUST::Core::IdMapper> object.

An C<Ali::Temporary> can be built from an existing ALI (or FASTA) file or
on-the-fly from a list (ArrayRef) of L<Bio::MUST::Core::Seq> objects (see the
SYNOPSIS for examples).

Its sequences can be aligned or not but by default sequences are degapped
before writing the associated temporary FASTA file. If gaps are to be
preserved, this behavior can be altered via the optional C<args> attribute.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 seqs

L<Bio::MUST::Core::Ali> object (required)

This required attribute contains the L<Bio::MUST::Core::Seq> objects that are
written in the associated temporary FASTA file. It can be specified either as
a path to an ALI/FASTA file or as an C<Ali> object or as an ArrayRef of C<Seq>
objects (see the SYNOPSIS for examples).

For now, it provides the following methods: C<count_comments>,
C<all_comments>, C<get_comment>, C<guessing>, C<all_seq_ids>, C<has_uniq_ids>,
C<is_protein>, C<is_aligned>, C<get_seq>, C<get_seq_with_id>, C<first_seq>,
C<all_seqs>, C<filter_seqs> and C<count_seqs> (see L<Bio::MUST::Core::Ali>).

=head2 args

HashRef (optional)

When specified this optional attribute is passed to the C<temp_fasta> method
of the internal C<Ali> object. Its purpose is to allow the fine-tuning of the
format of the associated temporary FASTA file.

By default, its contents is C<<clean => 1>> and C<<degap => 1>>, so as to
generate a FASTA file of degapped sequences where ambiguous and missing states
are replaced by C<X>.

Additionally, if you want to keep your temporary files around for debugging
purposes, you can pass the option C<<persistent => 1>>. This will disable the
autoremoval of the file on object destruction.

=head2 file

L<Path::Class::File> object (auto)

This attribute is automatically initialized with the path of the associated
temporary FASTA file. Thus, it cannot be user-specified.

It provides the following methods: C<remove> and C<filename> (see below).

=head2 mapper

L<Bio::MUST::Core::IdMapper> object (auto)

This attribute is automatically initialized with the mapper associating the
long ids of the internal C<Ali> object to the abbreviated ids used in the
associated temporary FASTA file. Thus, it cannot be user-specified.

It provides the following methods: C<all_long_ids>, C<all_abbr_ids>,
C<long_id_for> and C<abbr_id_for> (see L<Bio::MUST::Core::IdMapper>).

=head1 ACCESSORS

=head2 filename

Returns the stringified filename of the associated temporary FASTA file.

This method does not accept any arguments.

=head2 type

Returns the type of the sequences in the internal C<Ali> object using BLAST
denomination (C<prot> or C<nucl>). See L<Bio::MUST::Core::Seq::is_protein> for
the exact test performed.

This method does not accept any arguments.

=head1 MISC METHODS

=head2 remove

Remove (unlink) the associated temporary FASTA file.

Since this method is in principle automatically invoked on object destruction,
users should not need it. Note that C<persistent> temporary files (see object
constructor) have to be removed manually, which requires to get and store
their C<filename> before object destruction.
