Benchmark-MCE

Benchmark::MCE - Perl multi-core benchmarking framework

INSTALLATION

Normally you would expect to use a package manager like cpanm to install as:

    cpanm -n Benchmark::MCE

(This assumes you have the perl package App::cpanminus on your system, as well
as a C/make build environment - e.g. the "build-essential" apt package).

To install this module manually, run the following commands:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

This, however requires several CPAN modules. See setup_dkbench for more details.
