\begin{block}{Match the tool to the task}
\begin{enumerate}
\item You want to see the last 5 errors in a log file.
\item You want to read a 1GB text file without crashing your computer.
\item You want to see the first line of every \texttt{.txt} file in a directory.
\item You want to watch a log file update in real-time as you run a server.
\end{enumerate}
\end{block}
\begin{exampleblock}<2->{Answers}\label{sec:orgc6b9cf6}
\begin{enumerate}[<+->]
\item \texttt{tail -n 5}
\item \texttt{less} (it doesn't load the whole file at once!)
\item \texttt{head -n 1 *.txt}
\item \texttt{tail -f}
\end{enumerate}
\end{exampleblock}
