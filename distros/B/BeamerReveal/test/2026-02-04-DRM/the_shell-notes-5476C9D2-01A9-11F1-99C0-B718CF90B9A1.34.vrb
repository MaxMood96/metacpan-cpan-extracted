\begin{block}{The Challenge}
You are working on a massive project. You need to find a "TODO" comment related to "authentication" in any file.

\alert{\alert{Task:}} How would you find this line using only \texttt{grep}? Discuss with your neighbor the flags you'd need.
\end{block}
\begin{alertblock}<2->{Possible Solution}
\begin{verbatim}
$ grep -rn "TODO.*authentication" .
\end{verbatim}

\begin{itemize}
\item \alert{-r}: Search all files in all subdirectories.
\item \alert{-n}: Tell me exactly which line the comment is on!
\end{itemize}
\end{alertblock}
