Revision history for Concierge-Sessions

v0.10.0  2026-02-14
    - Updated test to account for timeout issues

v0.9.0 2026-02-13
    - Added META provides (resolves CPANTS meta_yml_has_provides)
    - Added SECURITY.md with vulnerability reporting policy
      (resolves CPANTS has_security_doc, security_doc_contains_contact)
    - Added CONTRIBUTING.md with contribution guidelines
      (resolves CPANTS has_contributing_doc)
    - Added xt/pod-no-nonascii.t author test to guard against non-ASCII in POD
    - Fixed stale POD versions in Base.pm, Session.pm, SQLite.pm, File.pm
    - Bumped all module versions to v0.9.0

v0.8.9 2026-02-13
    - Removed non-ASCII characters from POD in Files.pm

v0.8.8 2026-02-13
    - Switched session ID generation from Crypt::URandom to Crypt::PRNG
      (random_bytes), aligning with Concierge::Auth::Generators and reducing
      overall Concierge suite dependencies
    - CVE-2026-2439: Insecure session ID generation via uuidgen/rand fallback
      was fixed in v0.8.5; this entry documents the assigned CVE

v0.8.7 2026-02-13
    - Fixed CPAN tester timeout failures: session expiry in installation
      tests now mocked via direct SQLite update (no sleep). Real-time
      timeout tests moved to xt/ (author tests only, skipped under
      AUTOMATED_TESTING).

v0.8.6 2026-02-12
    - Rebuilt tarball with GNU tar (fixes PaxHeader issue on CPAN)

v0.8.5 2026-02-12
    - Security: replaced insecure session ID generation (uuidgen/rand fallback)
      with cryptographically secure random IDs via Crypt::URandom (160-bit entropy)
    - Added Crypt::URandom as a dependency
    - Further widened sliding window test timing margins for slow platforms

v0.8.4 2026-02-12
    - Fixed integration test timing margins for slow platforms (Windows/Strawberry Perl)

v0.8.3 2026-02-11
    - Fixed session expiration tests that were timing out too fast

v0.8.2 2026-02-11
    - Improved documentation

v0.8.1 2026-02-10
    - Initial CPAN release
    - SQLite and File storage backends
    - Session objects with get/set data, save, status checks
    - Sliding window expiration and indefinite sessions
    - Single-session enforcement per user
    - Expired session cleanup
