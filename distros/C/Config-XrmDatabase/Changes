0.03      2021-08-24 15:51:23-04:00 America/New_York

  [API BREAKAGE]

    * The to_kv method now takes an option hash, not a single value.

    * The query routine didn't document its return value (?!?) and
      what it returned has changed. So is this really an API break?

    * minimum Perl is now 5.26.


  [BUG FIX]

    * query(): the name of the matched key was incorrectly generated.

    * merge() was totally broken.

  [ENHANCEMENTS]

    * new method to_kv_arr, similar to to_kv, but the resource names
      are returned as arrays of components.

    * query() return value

        * by default returns the value on match or undef on failure.

        * may alternatively return a reference to the value so the
          user can distinguish between an undef value and a failed
          match

        * may alternatively return a hash of all of the data
          associated with the db entry that matched

    * query() failure action may now be specified

        * returns undef (default)

        * throws exception

        * caller can provide callback


0.02      2021-08-20 14:54:32-04:00 America/New_York

  [BUILD]

    * don't run tests matching against the Xresources code results if AUTOMATED_TESTING is set.

  [ENHANCEMENTS]

    * database entries keep track of how many times they've been
      matched.

    * new to_kv() method which returns the DB has a hash.

    * to_kv() can return the number of times a key was successfully
      matched by queries against the database


0.01      2021-08-19 15:09:41-04:00 America/New_York

* First release upon an unsuspecting world.
