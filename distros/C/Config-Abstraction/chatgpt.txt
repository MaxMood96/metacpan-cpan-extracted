Alright — Config::Abstraction is a great choice since it’s one of those “quietly essential” modules where better docs, examples, and test coverage can make it feel rock solid.

Here’s a **structured improvement plan** so we can hit usability, tests, bug fixes, improvements, and documentation without drifting:

---

## **1. Usability Improvements**

* **Clearer merge rules**
  Right now, the way it handles overrides from multiple sources could confuse new users.
  → Add a helper method `explain_sources()` that returns a list showing where each key came from and in what order they were applied.
* **Default config loading**
  Allow users to call something like `Config::Abstraction->new(defaults => \%hash)` so they don’t always have to load from a file or env.
* **Source priority shortcuts**
  Provide `->prefer_env`, `->prefer_file`, etc., so common priority schemes don’t require custom ordering arrays.

---

## **2. Testing**

* **Edge case coverage**

  * No sources provided.
  * Conflicting sources with same key.
  * Empty config files.
  * Special values like `undef`, empty string, zero.
* **Regression tests** for bugs found in the wild.
* **Test::Most** integration for cleaner, more expressive test scripts.

---

## **3. Bug Fixes**

* Verify that keys with `undef` values don’t accidentally get overridden by later sources unless explicitly intended.
* Confirm that nested hashes merge correctly instead of replacing whole structures unintentionally.

---

## **4. Improvements**

* **CLI tool** (optional) for dumping merged config to STDOUT — helps debugging.
* **YAML & JSON support** for file sources without needing separate code by the user.
* **Lazy loading** — only read sources when needed (could speed startup in bigger apps).

---

## **5. Documentation**

* **POD overhaul**

  * Clear SYNOPSIS with multiple real-life usage patterns:

    * Env → File → Defaults
    * Command-line args → File → Defaults
    * Multi-file layering
  * Show example of `explain_sources()` output.
  * Document merge precedence visually with a diagram.
* **"Common Pitfalls" section** for gotchas like nested merge behavior and `undef` handling.
* Add version history with notable changes for each release.

---

If you want, I can start by **writing new POD sections with clear examples** and then follow up with **a set of missing test files** so that improvements can be safely made.

Do you want me to start with **POD rewrite** or **test suite expansion** first?
