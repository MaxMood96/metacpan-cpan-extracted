- fix a potential under-allocation in generichash multipart state sizes

- fix missing export of mv_from_hex in MemVault

- minor bugfixes and improvements

0.000036 Aug 3 2025

- important update: return protected memory from pwhash function. the output is
  intended to be used as a secret, and this was an oversight in the original
  implementation.

- add new importable shortcut functions to memvault constructors

- replace undocumented memvault new_from_ttyno constructor with new_from_tty.
  this remains undocumented and not recommended for use pending further review.

- BUGFIX: fix overread on new length parameter for memvault new_from_fd|file

- a couple documentation changes are included

0.000034 Aug 1 2025

- protected memory functions were renamed to be more sensible.
  backwards-compatability aliases are there so code won't break. new protected
  memory flag functions added. see Crypt::Sodium::XS::ProtMem.

- minor change to arguments in MemVault new_from_fd|new_from_file. now takes an
  optional size argument before flags. pretty unlikely anyone was calling these
  with flags before, but if so it needs updating.

- update csxs-ppcrypt demo program. NOTE: arguments to this program have
  changed. encryption format has been extended, but is backwards compatible.

- fixes for pminisign demo program.

- test cleanup, and always disable strict mlock in tests.

- minor bugfixes and improvements

- kdf derive: use NV for id on platforms with less than 64-bit integers,
  allowing for 2 ** 53 - 1 ids.

  derivation of duplicate keys. see docs for details.
