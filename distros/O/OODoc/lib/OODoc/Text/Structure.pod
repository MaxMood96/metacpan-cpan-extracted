=head1 NAME

OODoc::Text::Structure - set of paragraphs with examples and subroutines

=head1 INHERITANCE

 OODoc::Text::Structure
   is an OODoc::Text
   is an OODoc::Object

 OODoc::Text::Structure is extended by
   OODoc::Text::Chapter
   OODoc::Text::Section
   OODoc::Text::SubSection
   OODoc::Text::SubSubSection

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 # Cannot be instantiated itself

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The L<OODoc::Text::Structure|OODoc::Text::Structure> class is used as base class for
the L<OODoc::Text::Chapter|OODoc::Text::Chapter>, L<OODoc::Text::Section|OODoc::Text::Section>, and
L<OODoc::Text::SubSection|OODoc::Text::SubSection> classes.  Each of these classes group some
paragraphs of text, probably some examples and some subroutines: they
provide a structure to the document.

at a higher level of inheritance to collect related subroutines and
such.

=head2 Location

=over 4

=item $obj-E<gt>B<findEntry>($name)

Find the chapter, section or subsection with this C<$name>.  The object found
is returned.

=item $obj-E<gt>B<path>()

Represent the location of this chapter, section, or subsection as
one string, separated by slashes.

example: path expression

 print $subsect->path; 
 # may print:  METHODS/Container/Search

=item $obj-E<gt>B<all>($method, \%parameters)

Call the C<$method> recursively on this object and all its sub-structures.
For instance, when called on a chapter, it first will call the C<$method> on
that chapter, than on all its sections, subsections, and subsubsections.
The C<%parameters> are passed with each call.  The results of all calls is
returned as LIST.

=item $obj-E<gt>B<isEmpty>()

Returns C<true> if this text structure is only a place holder for
something found in a super class.  Structured elements are created with
L<emptyExtension()|OODoc::Text::Structure/"Constructors"> on each sub-class pass the idea of order and to
collect subroutines to be listed.  However, in some cases, nothing is
to be listed after all, and in that case, this method returns C<true>.

example: 

 unless($chapter->isEmpty) ...

=head2 Subroutines

Each manual page structure element (chapter, section, subsection, and
subsubsection) can contain a list of subroutine descriptions.

=over 4

=item $obj-E<gt>B<addSubroutine>($objects)

A subroutine (L<OODoc::Text::Subroutine|OODoc::Text::Subroutine> object) is added to the
chapter, section, or subsection.

=item $obj-E<gt>B<setSubroutines>(\@subs)

Sets the subroutines which are related to this text structure, replacing
the preivous set.  This is used when the manual pages are expanded into
each-other to simplify working with the inheritance relations.

=item $obj-E<gt>B<subroutine>($name)

Returns the subroutine with the specific name.

=item $obj-E<gt>B<subroutines>()

Returns the list of subroutines which are related to this text object.

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

=over 4

=item Error: manual definition requires manual object

A call to L<addManual()|OODoc::Object/"Manual Repository"> expects a new manual object (a L<OODoc::Manual|OODoc::Manual>),
however an incompatible thing was passed.  Usually, intended was a call
to L<manualsForPackage()|OODoc::Object/"Manual Repository"> or L<mainManual()|OODoc::Object/"Manual Repository">.

=item Error: no level defined for structural component
