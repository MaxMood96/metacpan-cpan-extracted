DESCRIPTION
    Export Org format to HTML. To customize, you can subclass this module.

    A command-line utility org-to-html is available in the distribution
    App::OrgUtils.

    Note that this module is just a simple exporter, for "serious" work
    you'll probably want to use the exporting features or org-mode
    <http://orgmode.org>.

ATTRIBUTES
  naked => BOOL
    If set to true, export_document() will not output HTML/HEAD/BODY
    wrapping element. Default is false.

  html_title => STR
    Title to use in TITLE HTML element, to override "#+TITLE" setting in the
    Org document. If unset and document does not have "#+TITLE" setting,
    will default to the name of the source file, or "(source string)".

  css_url => STR
    If set, export_document() will output a LINK element pointing to this
    CSS.

  inline_images => BOOL
METHODS
  new(%args)
  $exp->export_document($doc) => HTML
    Export document to HTML.

FAQ
  Why would one want to use this instead of org-mode's built-in exporting features?
    This module might come in handy if you want to customize the Org-to-HTML
    translation with Perl, for example when you want to customize the
    default HTML title when there's no "#+TITLE" setting, change translation
    of table element to an ASCII table, etc.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
