=head1 GLOSSARY

=head2 I<iterable object>

An I<iterable object> is an object which can be wrapped by an L<Iterator::Flex::Base> based iterator,
and which has one or more of the following:

=over

=item *

C<__iter__> or C<iter> methods

=item *

C<__next__> or C<next> methods

=item *

an overloaded C<< <> >> operator

These should return the next item.

=item *

an overloaded C<< &{} >> operator

This should return a code reference which returns the next item.  The coderef
will be called as

  $next = $coderef->( $obj )

=item *

an overloaded C<< @{} >> operator

This should return a code reference which returns an array reference.   The coderef
will be called as

  $next = $coderef->( $obj )

=back

Additionally, if the object has the following methods, they are used
to implement the L<prev|Iterator::Flex::Manual::Overview/prev> and  L<current|Iterator::Flex::Manual::Overview/current> capabilities.

=over

=item *

C<__prev__> or C<prev>

=item *

C<__current__> or C<current>

=back

=head2 I<iterable thing>

An I<iterable thing> is an entity which can be wrapped by an L<Iterator::Flex::Base> based iterator.

It may be one of the following:

=over

=item *

an L</iterable object>

=item *

an arrayref

=item *

a coderef, which must return the next element in the iteration.

=item *

a globref, assumed to be a filehandle.
