=head1 NAME

Iterator::Flex::Manual::Caveats - Caveats

=head1 VERSION

version 0.29

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head2 Serialization

Serialization is a work in progress

Most of the machinery is in place, but it requires some cleanup

=over

=item *

The freeze code must be made available via the L<Iterator::Flex::Manual::Overview/freeze> parameter.
It should be possible to use an object method.

This is a simple fix: convert the single L<Iterator::Flex::Role::Freeze> role into
separate C<Iterator::Flex::Role::Freeze::Closure>  and C<Iterator::Flex::Role::Freeze::Method> roles.
