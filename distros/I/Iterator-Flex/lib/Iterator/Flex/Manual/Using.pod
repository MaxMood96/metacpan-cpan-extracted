=head1 INTERNALS

=head1 METHODS

Not all iterators support all methods.

=over

=item prev

  $value = $iter->prev;

Returns the previous value of the iterator.  If the iterator was never
advanced, this returns C<undef>.  If the iterator is exhausted, this
returns the last retrieved value.

=item current

  $value = $iter->current;

Returns the current value of the iterator.  If the iterator was never
advanced, this returns undef.  If the iterator is exhausted, this
returns C<undef>.

=item next

  $value = $iter->next;

Return the next value from the iterator.

=item rewind

  $iter->rewind;

Resets the iterator so that the next value returned is the very first
value.  It should not affect the results of the L</prev> and L</current>
methods.

=item reset

  $iter->reset;

Resets the iterator to its initial state.  The iterator's state is not
changed.

=item is_exhausted

  $iter->is_exhausted;

True if the iterator is in the L<exhausted
state|Iterator::Flex::Manual::Overview/Exhausted State>.  A false
value does I<not> indicate that further data are available, only that
the iterator has not yet transitioned from I<Iteration> to
I<Exhausted>.  In general, iterators

=item is_error

  $iter->is_error;

True if the iterator is in the L<error state|Iterator::Flex::Manual::Overview/Error State>.
