=head1 NAME

Iterator::Flex::Role::Next::Closure - Construct a next() method for iterators without closed over $self

=head1 VERSION

version 0.25

=head1 METHODS

=head2 next

=head2 __next__

   $iterator->next;

Wrapper for iterator next callback optimized for the case where
iterator exhaustion is handled by the iterator.  Typically this means
the iterator closure calls C<< $self->signal_exhaustion >>, which is added
by a specific C<Iterator::Flex::Role::Exhaustion> role.
