# ABSTRACT: Compartmentalize Iterator::Flex::Method::Maker

use strict;
use warnings;
use experimental 'signatures';

our $VERSION = '0.28';

# Package::Variant based modules generate constructor functions
# dynamically when those modules are imported.  However, loading the
# module via require() then calling its import method must be done
# only once, otherwise Perl will emit multiply defined errors for the
# constructor functions.

# By layering the Package::Variant based module in an inner package
# and calling its import here, the constructor function, Maker(), is
# generated just once, as Iterator::Flex::Method::Maker, and is
# available to any caller by it's fully qualified name.

Iterator::Flex::Method::Maker->import;

## no critic( MultiplePackages )
package Iterator::Flex::Method::Maker {

    use Iterator::Flex::Utils qw( :default REG_ITERATOR REG_ITER_METHODS );
    use Package::Variant importing => qw[ Role::Tiny ];
    use Module::Runtime;

    sub make_variant_package_name ( $, $package, % ) {

        $package = "Iterator::Flex::Role::Method::$package";

        if ( Role::Tiny->is_role( $package ) ) {
            require Iterator::Flex::Failure;
            Iterator::Flex::Failure::RoleExists->throw( { payload => $package } );
        }
