NAME

    IO::Async::Loop::FutureIO - use IO::Async with Future::IO

SYNOPSIS

       use IO::Async::Loop::FutureIO;
    
       use Future::IO:
       Future::IO->load_best_impl;

DESCRIPTION

    This subclass of IO::Async::Loop uses Future::IO to perform its work.

    Currently there are a few features that don't yet work, due to missing
    support from Future::IO itself. Hopefully a later version of Future::IO
    will be able to provide these missing pieces, and then this module will
    be shipped by default in the main IO-Async distribution.

 Missing Features

    Currently the following things do not work with this module:

    Signals

      The watch_signal and unwatch_signal methods are not currently
      implemented, because Future::IO does not support a general purpose
      signal wait ability. Once this is available, these methods can be
      added.

    Watching PID 0

      Likewise, as Future::IO only supports watching specific PIDs and not
      a repeating wait for any process, this is not permitted here.

    is_running

      The is_running method cannot reliably answer whether Future::IO
      itself is currently blocked awaiting IO, so it is also not provided.

    Metrics

      This module would not be able to provide metrics on the overall
      operation of Future::IO, so it is not provided.
