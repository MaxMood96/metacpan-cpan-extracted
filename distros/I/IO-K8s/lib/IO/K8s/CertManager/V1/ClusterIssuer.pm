=head1 NAME

IO::K8s::CertManager::V1::ClusterIssuer - cert-manager cluster-scoped certificate issuer

=head1 VERSION

version 1.005

=head1 DESCRIPTION

ClusterIssuer configures a cluster-wide certificate issuer, available to Certificate resources in any namespace. This is a cluster-scoped resource using the C<cert-manager.io/v1> API version. It functions similarly to Issuer but is not limited to a single namespace. The C<spec> and C<status> attributes contain opaque HashRefs whose structure is defined by cert-manager's OpenAPI schema.
