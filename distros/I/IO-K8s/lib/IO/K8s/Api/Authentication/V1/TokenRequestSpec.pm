=head1 NAME

IO::K8s::Api::Authentication::V1::TokenRequestSpec - TokenRequestSpec contains client provided parameters of a token request.

=head1 VERSION

version 1.001

=head2 audiences

Audiences are the intendend audiences of the token. A recipient of a token must identify themself with an identifier in the list of audiences of the token, and otherwise should reject the token. A token issued for multiple audiences may be used to authenticate against any of the audiences listed but implies a high degree of trust between the target audiences.

=head2 boundObjectRef

BoundObjectRef is a reference to an object that the token will be bound to. The token will only be valid for as long as the bound object exists. NOTE: The API server's TokenReview endpoint will validate the BoundObjectRef, but other audiences may not. Keep ExpirationSeconds small if you want prompt revocation.

=head2 expirationSeconds

ExpirationSeconds is the requested duration of validity of the request. The token issuer may return a token with a different validity duration so a client needs to check the 'expiration' field in a response.
