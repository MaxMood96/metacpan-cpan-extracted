=head1 NAME

IO::K8s::Api::Flowcontrol::V1beta3::FlowSchemaSpec - FlowSchemaSpec describes how the FlowSchema's specification looks like.

=head1 VERSION

version 1.001

=head2 distinguisherMethod

C<distinguisherMethod> defines how to compute the flow distinguisher for requests that match this schema. C<nil> specifies that the distinguisher is disabled and thus will always be the empty string.

=head2 matchingPrecedence

C<matchingPrecedence> is used to choose among the FlowSchemas that match a given request. The chosen FlowSchema is among those with the numerically lowest (which we take to be logically highest) MatchingPrecedence. Each MatchingPrecedence value must be ranged in [1,10000]. Note that if the precedence is not specified, it will be set to 1000 as default.

=head2 priorityLevelConfiguration

C<priorityLevelConfiguration> should reference a PriorityLevelConfiguration in the cluster. If the reference cannot be resolved, the FlowSchema will be ignored and marked as invalid in its status. Required.

=head2 rules

C<rules> describes which requests will match this flow schema. This FlowSchema matches a request if and only if at least one member of rules matches the request. if it is an empty slice, there will be no requests matching the FlowSchema.
