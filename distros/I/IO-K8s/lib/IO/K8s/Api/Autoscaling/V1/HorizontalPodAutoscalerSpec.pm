=head1 NAME

IO::K8s::Api::Autoscaling::V1::HorizontalPodAutoscalerSpec - specification of a horizontal pod autoscaler.

=head1 VERSION

version 1.001

=head2 maxReplicas

maxReplicas is the upper limit for the number of pods that can be set by the autoscaler; cannot be smaller than MinReplicas.

=head2 minReplicas

minReplicas is the lower limit for the number of replicas to which the autoscaler can scale down.  It defaults to 1 pod.  minReplicas is allowed to be 0 if the alpha feature gate HPAScaleToZero is enabled and at least one Object or External metric is configured.  Scaling is active as long as at least one metric value is available.

=head2 scaleTargetRef

reference to scaled resource; horizontal pod autoscaler will learn the current resource consumption and will set the desired number of pods by using its Scale subresource.

=head2 targetCPUUtilizationPercentage

targetCPUUtilizationPercentage is the target average CPU utilization (represented as a percentage of requested CPU) over all the pods; if not specified the default autoscaling policy will be used.
