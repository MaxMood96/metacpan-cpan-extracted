=head1 NAME

IO::K8s::Api::Autoscaling::V1::HorizontalPodAutoscalerStatus - current status of a horizontal pod autoscaler

=head1 VERSION

version 1.005

=head2 currentCPUUtilizationPercentage

currentCPUUtilizationPercentage is the current average CPU utilization over all pods, represented as a percentage of requested CPU, e.g. 70 means that an average pod is using now 70% of its requested CPU.

=head2 currentReplicas

currentReplicas is the current number of replicas of pods managed by this autoscaler.

=head2 desiredReplicas

desiredReplicas is the  desired number of replicas of pods managed by this autoscaler.

=head2 lastScaleTime

lastScaleTime is the last time the HorizontalPodAutoscaler scaled the number of pods; used by the autoscaler to control how often the number of pods is changed.

=head2 observedGeneration

observedGeneration is the most recent generation observed by this autoscaler.
