=head1 NAME

IO::K8s::Api::Core::V1::VolumeProjection - Projection that may be projected along with other supported volume types. Exactly one of these fields must be set.

=head1 VERSION

version 1.001

=head2 clusterTrustBundle

ClusterTrustBundle allows a pod to access the `.spec.trustBundle` field of ClusterTrustBundle objects in an auto-updating file.

Alpha, gated by the ClusterTrustBundleProjection feature gate.

ClusterTrustBundle objects can either be selected by name, or by the combination of signer name and a label selector.

Kubelet performs aggressive normalization of the PEM contents written into the pod filesystem.  Esoteric PEM features such as inter-block comments and block headers are stripped.  Certificates are deduplicated. The ordering of certificates within the file is arbitrary, and Kubelet may change the order over time.

=head2 configMap

configMap information about the configMap data to project

=head2 downwardAPI

downwardAPI information about the downwardAPI data to project

=head2 secret
