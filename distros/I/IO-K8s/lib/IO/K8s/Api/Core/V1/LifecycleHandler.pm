=head1 NAME

IO::K8s::Api::Core::V1::LifecycleHandler - LifecycleHandler defines a specific action that should be taken in a lifecycle hook. One and only one of the fields, except TCPSocket must be specified.

=head1 VERSION

version 1.005

=head2 exec

Exec specifies the action to take.

=head2 httpGet

HTTPGet specifies the http request to perform.

=head2 sleep

Sleep represents the duration that the container should sleep before being terminated.

=head2 tcpSocket

Deprecated. TCPSocket is NOT supported as a LifecycleHandler and kept for the backward compatibility. There are no validation of this field and lifecycle hooks will fail in runtime when tcp handler is specified.
