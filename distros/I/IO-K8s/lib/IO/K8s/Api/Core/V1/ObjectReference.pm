=head1 NAME

IO::K8s::Api::Core::V1::ObjectReference - ObjectReference contains enough information to let you inspect or modify the referred object.

=head1 VERSION

version 1.001

=head2 apiVersion

API version of the referent.

=head2 fieldPath

If referring to a piece of an object instead of an entire object, this string should contain a valid JSON/Go field access statement, such as desiredState.manifest.containers[2]. For example, if the object reference is to a container within a pod, this would take on a value like: "spec.containers{name}" (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered the event) or if no container name is specified "spec.containers[2]" (container with index 2 in this pod). This syntax is chosen only to have some well-defined way of referencing a part of an object.
