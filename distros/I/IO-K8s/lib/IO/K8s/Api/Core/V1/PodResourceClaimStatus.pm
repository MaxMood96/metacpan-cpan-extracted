=head1 NAME

IO::K8s::Api::Core::V1::PodResourceClaimStatus - PodResourceClaimStatus is stored in the PodStatus for each PodResourceClaim which references a ResourceClaimTemplate. It stores the generated name for the corresponding ResourceClaim.

=head1 VERSION

version 1.000

=head2 name

Name uniquely identifies this resource claim inside the pod. This must match the name of an entry in pod.spec.resourceClaims, which implies that the string must be a DNS_LABEL.

=head2 resourceClaimName

ResourceClaimName is the name of the ResourceClaim that was generated for the Pod in the namespace of the Pod. If this is unset, then generating a ResourceClaim was not necessary. The pod.spec.resourceClaims entry can be ignored in this case.
