=head1 NAME

IO::K8s::Api::Core::V1::EndpointPort - EndpointPort is a tuple that describes a single port.

=head1 VERSION

version 1.000

=head2 appProtocol

The application protocol for this port. This is used as a hint for implementations to offer richer behavior for protocols that they understand. This field follows standard Kubernetes label syntax. Valid values are either:

* Un-prefixed protocol names - reserved for IANA standard service names (as per RFC-6335 and https://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names).

* Kubernetes-defined prefixed names:
  * 'kubernetes.io/h2c' - HTTP/2 prior knowledge over cleartext as described in https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9113.html#name-starting-http-2-with-prior-
  * 'kubernetes.io/ws'  - WebSocket over cleartext as described in https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6455
  * 'kubernetes.io/wss' - WebSocket over TLS as described in https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6455

* Other protocols should use implementation-defined prefixed names such as mycompany.com/my-custom-protocol.

=head2 name

The name of this port.  This must match the 'name' field in the corresponding ServicePort. Must be a DNS_LABEL. Optional only if one port is defined.

=head2 port

The port number of the endpoint.

=head2 protocol

The IP protocol for this port. Must be UDP, TCP, or SCTP. Default is TCP.
