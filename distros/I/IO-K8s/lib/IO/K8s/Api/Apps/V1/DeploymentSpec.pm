=head1 NAME

IO::K8s::Api::Apps::V1::DeploymentSpec - DeploymentSpec is the specification of the desired behavior of the Deployment.

=head1 VERSION

version 1.000

=head2 minReadySeconds

Minimum number of seconds for which a newly created pod should be ready without any of its container crashing, for it to be considered available. Defaults to 0 (pod will be considered available as soon as it is ready)

=head2 paused

Indicates that the deployment is paused.

=head2 progressDeadlineSeconds

The maximum time in seconds for a deployment to make progress before it is considered to be failed. The deployment controller will continue to process failed deployments and a condition with a ProgressDeadlineExceeded reason will be surfaced in the deployment status. Note that progress will not be estimated during the time a deployment is paused. Defaults to 600s.

=head2 replicas

Number of desired pods. This is a pointer to distinguish between explicit zero and not specified. Defaults to 1.

=head2 revisionHistoryLimit

The number of old ReplicaSets to retain to allow rollback. This is a pointer to distinguish between explicit zero and not specified. Defaults to 10.

=head2 selector

Label selector for pods. Existing ReplicaSets whose pods are selected by this will be the ones affected by this deployment. It must match the pod template's labels.

=head2 strategy

The deployment strategy to use to replace existing pods with new ones.

=head2 template

Template describes the pods that will be created. The only allowed template.spec.restartPolicy value is "Always".
