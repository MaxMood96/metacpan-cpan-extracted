=head1 NAME

IO::K8s::Api::Apps::V1::RollingUpdateStatefulSetStrategy - RollingUpdateStatefulSetStrategy is used to communicate parameter for RollingUpdateStatefulSetStrategyType.

=head1 VERSION

version 1.002

=head2 maxUnavailable

The maximum number of pods that can be unavailable during the update. Value can be an absolute number (ex: 5) or a percentage of desired pods (ex: 10%). Absolute number is calculated from percentage by rounding up. This can not be 0. Defaults to 1. This field is alpha-level and is only honored by servers that enable the MaxUnavailableStatefulSet feature. The field applies to all pods in the range 0 to Replicas-1. That means if there is any unavailable pod in the range 0 to Replicas-1, it will be counted towards MaxUnavailable.

=head2 partition

Partition indicates the ordinal at which the StatefulSet should be partitioned for updates. During a rolling update, all pods from ordinal Replicas-1 to Partition are updated. All pods from ordinal Partition-1 to 0 remain untouched. This is helpful in being able to do a canary based deployment. The default value is 0.
