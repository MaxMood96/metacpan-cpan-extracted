=head1 NAME

IO::K8s::Api::Apps::V1::StatefulSetStatus - StatefulSetStatus represents the current state of a StatefulSet.

=head1 VERSION

version 1.005

=head2 availableReplicas

Total number of available pods (ready for at least minReadySeconds) targeted by this statefulset.

=head2 collisionCount

collisionCount is the count of hash collisions for the StatefulSet. The StatefulSet controller uses this field as a collision avoidance mechanism when it needs to create the name for the newest ControllerRevision.

=head2 conditions

Represents the latest available observations of a statefulset's current state.

=head2 currentReplicas

currentReplicas is the number of Pods created by the StatefulSet controller from the StatefulSet version indicated by currentRevision.

=head2 currentRevision

currentRevision, if not empty, indicates the version of the StatefulSet used to generate Pods in the sequence [0,currentReplicas).

=head2 observedGeneration

observedGeneration is the most recent generation observed for this StatefulSet. It corresponds to the StatefulSet's generation, which is updated on mutation by the API Server.

=head2 readyReplicas

readyReplicas is the number of pods created for this StatefulSet with a Ready Condition.

=head2 replicas

replicas is the number of Pods created by the StatefulSet controller.

=head2 updateRevision

updateRevision, if not empty, indicates the version of the StatefulSet used to generate Pods in the sequence [replicas-updatedReplicas,replicas)

=head2 updatedReplicas

updatedReplicas is the number of Pods created by the StatefulSet controller from the StatefulSet version indicated by updateRevision.
