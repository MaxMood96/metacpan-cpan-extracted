=head1 NAME

IO::K8s::Api::Apps::V1::StatefulSetOrdinals - StatefulSetOrdinals describes the policy used for replica ordinal assignment in this StatefulSet.

=head1 VERSION

version 1.001

=head2 start

start is the number representing the first replica's index. It may be used to number replicas from an alternate index (eg: 1-indexed) over the default 0-indexed names, or to orchestrate progressive movement of replicas from one StatefulSet to another. If set, replica indices will be in the range: [.spec.ordinals.start, .spec.ordinals.start + .spec.replicas). If unset, defaults to 0. Replica indices will be in the range: [0, .spec.replicas).
