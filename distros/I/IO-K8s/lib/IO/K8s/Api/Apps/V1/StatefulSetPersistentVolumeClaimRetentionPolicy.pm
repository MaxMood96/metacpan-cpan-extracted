=head1 NAME

IO::K8s::Api::Apps::V1::StatefulSetPersistentVolumeClaimRetentionPolicy - StatefulSetPersistentVolumeClaimRetentionPolicy describes the policy used for PVCs created from the StatefulSet VolumeClaimTemplates.

=head1 VERSION

version 1.002

=head2 whenDeleted

WhenDeleted specifies what happens to PVCs created from StatefulSet VolumeClaimTemplates when the StatefulSet is deleted. The default policy of `Retain` causes PVCs to not be affected by StatefulSet deletion. The `Delete` policy causes those PVCs to be deleted.

=head2 whenScaled

WhenScaled specifies what happens to PVCs created from StatefulSet VolumeClaimTemplates when the StatefulSet is scaled down. The default policy of `Retain` causes PVCs to not be affected by a scaledown. The `Delete` policy causes the associated PVCs for any excess pods above the replica count to be deleted.
