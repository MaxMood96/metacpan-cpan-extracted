=head1 NAME

IO::K8s::Api::Batch::V1::PodFailurePolicy - PodFailurePolicy describes how failed pods influence the backoffLimit.

=head1 VERSION

version 1.005

=head2 rules

A list of pod failure policy rules. The rules are evaluated in order. Once a rule matches a Pod failure, the remaining of the rules are ignored. When no rule matches the Pod failure, the default handling applies - the counter of pod failures is incremented and it is checked against the backoffLimit. At most 20 elements are allowed.
