=head1 NAME

IO::K8s::Api::Batch::V1::CronJobSpec - CronJobSpec describes how the job execution will look like and when it will actually run.

=head1 VERSION

version 1.000

=head2 concurrencyPolicy

Specifies how to treat concurrent executions of a Job. Valid values are:

- "Allow" (default): allows CronJobs to run concurrently; - "Forbid": forbids concurrent runs, skipping next run if previous run hasn't finished yet; - "Replace": cancels currently running job and replaces it with a new one

=head2 failedJobsHistoryLimit

The number of failed finished jobs to retain. Value must be non-negative integer. Defaults to 1.

=head2 jobTemplate

Specifies the job that will be created when executing a CronJob.

=head2 schedule

The schedule in Cron format, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron.

=head2 startingDeadlineSeconds

Optional deadline in seconds for starting the job if it misses scheduled time for any reason.  Missed jobs executions will be counted as failed ones.

=head2 successfulJobsHistoryLimit

The number of successful finished jobs to retain. Value must be non-negative integer. Defaults to 3.

=head2 suspend

This flag tells the controller to suspend subsequent executions, it does not apply to already started executions.  Defaults to false.

=head2 timeZone

The time zone name for the given schedule, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones. If not specified, this will default to the time zone of the kube-controller-manager process. The set of valid time zone names and the time zone offset is loaded from the system-wide time zone database by the API server during CronJob validation and the controller manager during execution. If no system-wide time zone database can be found a bundled version of the database is used instead. If the time zone name becomes invalid during the lifetime of a CronJob or due to a change in host configuration, the controller will stop creating new new Jobs and will create a system event with the reason UnknownTimeZone. More information can be found in https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/cron-jobs/#time-zones
