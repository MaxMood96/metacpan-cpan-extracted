=head1 NAME

IO::K8s::Api::Batch::V1::PodFailurePolicyRule - PodFailurePolicyRule describes how a pod failure is handled when the requirements are met. One of onExitCodes and onPodConditions, but not both, can be used in each rule.

=head1 VERSION

version 1.002

=head2 action

Specifies the action taken on a pod failure when the requirements are satisfied. Possible values are:

- FailJob: indicates that the pod's job is marked as Failed and all running pods are terminated.
- FailIndex: indicates that the pod's index is marked as Failed and will not be restarted. This value is beta-level. It can be used when the `JobBackoffLimitPerIndex` feature gate is enabled (enabled by default).
- Ignore: indicates that the counter towards the .backoffLimit is not incremented and a replacement pod is created.
- Count: indicates that the pod is handled in the default way - the counter towards the .backoffLimit is incremented.

Additional values are considered to be added in the future. Clients should react to an unknown action by skipping the rule.

=head2 onExitCodes

Represents the requirement on the container exit codes.

=head2 onPodConditions

Represents the requirement on the pod conditions. The requirement is represented as a list of pod condition patterns. The requirement is satisfied if at least one pattern matches an actual pod condition. At most 20 elements are allowed.
