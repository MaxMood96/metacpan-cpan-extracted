=head1 NAME

IO::K8s::Api::Storage::V1::VolumeNodeResources - VolumeNodeResources is a set of resource limits for scheduling of volumes.

=head1 VERSION

version 1.005

=head2 count

count indicates the maximum number of unique volumes managed by the CSI driver that can be used on a node. A volume that is both attached and mounted on a node is considered to be used once, not twice. The same rule applies for a unique volume that is shared among multiple pods on the same node. If this field is not specified, then the supported number of volumes on this node is unbounded.
