=head1 NAME

IO::K8s::Api::Node::V1::Scheduling - Scheduling specifies the scheduling constraints for nodes supporting a RuntimeClass.

=head1 VERSION

version 1.001

=head2 nodeSelector

nodeSelector lists labels that must be present on nodes that support this RuntimeClass. Pods using this RuntimeClass can only be scheduled to a node matched by this selector. The RuntimeClass nodeSelector is merged with a pod's existing nodeSelector. Any conflicts will cause the pod to be rejected in admission.

=head2 tolerations

tolerations are appended (excluding duplicates) to pods running with this RuntimeClass during admission, effectively unioning the set of nodes tolerated by the pod and the RuntimeClass.
