=head2 jsonPath

jsonPath is a simple JSON path which is evaluated against each custom resource to produce a field selector value. Only JSON paths without the array notation are allowed. Must point to a field of type string, boolean or integer. Types with enum values and strings with formats are allowed. If jsonPath refers to absent field in a resource, the jsonPath evaluates to an empty string. Must not point to metdata fields. Required.
