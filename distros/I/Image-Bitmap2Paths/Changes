Revision history for Perl extension Image::Bitmap2Paths.

0.01  Fri Jun  6 08:31:47 2025
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.23 with options
		-Xn Image::Bitmap2Paths

      Factored out of the script hex_parse.pl v1.232.  With
      examples/hex2font.pl produces the same results (on glyphs in
      planes 0,1,e of unifont-16.0.04) with both output_sfd_char()
      and output_human_readable().

      The test suite and the docs are very rudimentary now.

  script/hex2font.pl	The remaining part of hex_parse.pl.  Produces
			identical output in the debugging and --sfd
			modes.  (_test_encodes_line() not tested!)

  t/Image-Bitmap2Paths.t	The minimal test suite.  So far only
  				useful for the initial bootstrap of
  				factoring out into two parts.  (The
  				real testing happens by comparing
  				the generated Unifont Smooth glyphs.)
