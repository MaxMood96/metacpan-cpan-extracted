=head1 NAME

Log::Report::Lexicon - translation component of Log::Report

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is the main extry point for the distribution, but has
currently no further use.  This distribution contains all components
of Log::Report which handle translations.

If you do not need translations, you do not need to install this module.
When you use Log::Report and need to add translations, it may be
very little work: when you nicely wrote texts in the advised message
format like

  print __x"Greetings to you, {name}", name => $name;
  fault __x"cannot open file {filename}", filename => $fn;

then all is in perfect condition to introduce translations: it requires
very little to no additions to the existing code!

In this distribution:
