=head1 NAME

Log::Report::Lexicon::MOTcompact - use translations from an MO file

=head1 INHERITANCE

 Log::Report::Lexicon::MOTcompact
   is a Log::Report::Lexicon::Table

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # using a MO table efficiently
  my $mot = Log::Report::Lexicon::MOTcompact->read('mo/nl.mo')
     or die;

  my $header = $mot->msgid('');
  print $mot->msgstr($msgid, 3);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is translating, based on MO files (binary versions of
the PO files, the "Machine Object" format)

Actually, this module is not "compact" anymore: not trading off
speed for memory.  That may change again in the future.

To get a MO file, you first need a PO file.  Then run F<msgfmt>, which
is part of the gnu gettext package.

  msgfmt -cv -o $domain.mo $domain.po

  # -c = --check-format & --check-header & --check-domain
  # -v = --verbose
  # -o = --output-file

=item $class-E<gt>B<new>(%options)

Read the MOT table information from C<$filename>.

 -Option --Default
  charset  <from header>

=over 2

=item charset => STRING

The character-set which is used for the file.  When not specified, it is
taken from the "Content-Type" field in the PO-file.

=head2 Attributes

=over 4

=item $obj-E<gt>B<filename>()

Returns the name of the source file for this data.

=item $obj-E<gt>B<index>()

Returns a HASH of all defined PO objects, organized by msgid.  Please try
to avoid using this: use L<msgid()|Log::Report::Lexicon::MOTcompact/"Managing PO's"> for lookup.

=item $obj-E<gt>B<originalCharset>()

Returns the character-set as found in the PO-file.  The strings are
converted into utf8 before you use them in the program.

=head3 Translation

Extends L<"Translation" in Log::Report::Lexicon::Table|Log::Report::Lexicon::Table/"Translation">.

=over 4

=item $obj-E<gt>B<msgid>( STRING, [$msgctxt] )

Lookup the translations with the C<STRING>.  Returns a SCALAR, when only
one translation is known, and an ARRAY when we have plural forms.
Returns C<undef> when the translation is not defined.
Improves base, see L<Log::Report::Lexicon::Table/"Translation">

=item $obj-E<gt>B<msgstr>( $msgid, [$count, $msgctxt] )

Returns the translated string for C<$msgid>.  When not specified, C<$count> is 1
(the singular form).
