Log::Report::Lexicon::PO - one translation definition

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is administering one translation object.  Sets of PO
records are kept in a POT file, implemented in L<Log::Report::Lexicon::POT|Log::Report::Lexicon::POT>.

=item automatic => PARAGRAPH

Automatically added comments.
See L<addAutomatic()|Log::Report::Lexicon::PO/"Attributes">.

=item comment => PARAGRAPH

Translator added comments.
See L<addComment()|Log::Report::Lexicon::PO/"Attributes">.

=item format => ARRAY|HASH

See L<format()|Log::Report::Lexicon::PO/"Attributes">.  Either an ARRAY with PAIRS or a HASH with that same
information.

=item fuzzy => BOOLEAN

The string is not yet translated, some smart guesses may have been made.
See L<fuzzy()|Log::Report::Lexicon::PO/"Attributes">.

=item msgctxt => STRING

Context string: text around the msgid itself.

=item msgid => STRING

=item msgid_plural => STRING

=item msgstr => STRING|ARRAY-OF-STRING

The translations for the msgid.  When msgid_plural is defined, then an
ARRAY must be provided.

=item references => STRING|ARRAY-OF-LOCATIONS

The STRING is a blank separated list of LOCATIONS.
LOCATIONs are of the  form C<filename:linenumber>, for
instance C<lib/Foo.pm:42>
See L<addReferences()|Log::Report::Lexicon::PO/"Attributes">

=item $obj-E<gt>B<addAutomatic>(LIST|ARRAY|STRING)

Add multiple lines to the translator's comment block.  Returns an
empty string if there are no comments.

=item $obj-E<gt>B<addComment>(LIST|ARRAY|STRING)

Add multiple lines to the translator's comment block.  Returns an
empty string if there are no comments.

=item $obj-E<gt>B<addFlags>(STRING)

Parse a "flags" line.

=item $obj-E<gt>B<addReferences>(STRING|LIST|ARRAY)

The C<STRING> is a blank separated list of LOCATIONS.  The C<LIST> and
C<ARRAY> contain separate LOCATIONs.  A LOCATION is of the form
C<filename:linenumber>.  Returns the internal HASH with references.

=item $obj-E<gt>B<automatic>( [LIST|ARRAY|STRING] )

Returns a C<STRING> which contains the cleaned paragraph of automatically
added comments.  If an argument is specified, it will replace the current
comment.

=item $obj-E<gt>B<comment>( [LIST|ARRAY|STRING] )

Returns a C<STRING> which contains the cleaned paragraph of translator's
comment.  If an argument is specified, it will replace the current
comment.

=item $obj-E<gt>B<format>( $language | <PAIRS|ARRAY|HASH> )

When one C<$language> is specified, it looks whether a "language-format" or
"no-language-format" is present in the line of FLAGS.  This will return
C<1> (C<true>) in the first case, C<0> (C<false>) in the second case.  It will
return C<undef> (also C<false>) in case that both are not present.

You can also specify C<PAIRS>: the key is a language name, and the
value is either C<0>, C<1>, or C<undef>.

example: use of format()

  # getters
  if($po->format('c')) ...
  unless($po->format('perl-brace')) ...
  if(defined $po->format('java')) ...

  # setters
  $po->format(java => 1);       # results in 'java-format'
  $po->format(java => 0);       # results in 'no-java-format'
  $po->format(java => undef);   # results in ''

=item $obj-E<gt>B<fuzzy>( [BOOLEAN] )

Returns whether the translation needs human inspection.

=item $obj-E<gt>B<isActive>()

Returns whether the translation has any references, or is the header.

=item $obj-E<gt>B<keepReferencesTo>($table)

Remove all references which are not found as key in the hash C<$table>.
Returns the number of references left.

=item $obj-E<gt>B<msgctxt>()

Returns the message context, if provided.

=item $obj-E<gt>B<msgid>()

Returns the actual msgid, which cannot be C<undef>.

=item $obj-E<gt>B<msgstr>( [$index, [STRING]] )

With a C<STRING>, a new translation will be set.  Without C<STRING>, a
lookup will take place.  When no plural is defined, the C<$index> is
ignored.

=item $obj-E<gt>B<plural>( [STRING] )

Returns the actual msgid_plural, which can be C<undef>.

=item $obj-E<gt>B<references>( [STRING|LIST|ARRAY] )

Returns an unsorted list of LOCATIONS.  When options are specified,
then those will be used to replace all currently defined references.
Returns the unsorted C<LIST> of references.

=item $obj-E<gt>B<removeReferencesTo>($filename)

Remove all the references to the indicate C<$filename> from the list.  Returns
the number of refs left.

=back

=head2 Parsing

=over 4

=item $class-E<gt>B<fromText>( STRING, [$where] )

Parse the C<STRING> into a new PO object.  The C<$where> string should explain
the location of the C<STRING>, to be used in error messages.

=item $obj-E<gt>B<toString>(%options)

Format the object into a multi-lined string.

 -Option    --Default
  nr_plurals  undef

=over 2

=item nr_plurals => INTEGER

If the number of plurals is specified, then the plural translation
list can be checked for the correct length.  Otherwise, no smart
behavior is attempted.

=back

=item $obj-E<gt>B<useless>()

[1.02] The message-id has no references anymore B<and> no translations.
