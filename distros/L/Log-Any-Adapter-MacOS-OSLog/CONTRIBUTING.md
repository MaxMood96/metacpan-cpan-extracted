# How to contribute to this distribution

-   I prefer to get pull requests rather than patches.
    Please do pull requests on branches.
-   Please add an entry for each change in Changes as well.
-   If it's a significant change, please email me first,
    so we can discuss it, and I can tag it as being worked on.
