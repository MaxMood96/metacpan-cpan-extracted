Revision history for LTSV::LINQ

1.03  2026-02-20

    New methods (6):
    - Join($inner, $outer_key, $inner_key, $result)
          Inner join; inner sequence is fully buffered at call time.
    - GroupJoin($inner, $outer_key, $inner_key, $result)
          Left outer join; inner sequence fully buffered.
          Inner group passed to result_selector as a re-iterable
          LTSV::LINQ object (supports Count, Sum, Any, Where, etc.
          called multiple times on the same group).
    - OrderByStr($key_selector)
          Sort ascending using string comparison (cmp) unconditionally.
    - OrderByStrDescending($key_selector)
          Sort descending using string comparison (cmp) unconditionally.
    - OrderByNum($key_selector)
          Sort ascending using numeric comparison (<=>) unconditionally.
          Undefined keys treated as 0.
    - OrderByNumDescending($key_selector)
          Sort descending using numeric comparison (<=>) unconditionally.

    Behavioural changes:
    - GroupBy: groups are now returned in insertion order (first-seen key),
          matching .NET LINQ behaviour.  Previously sorted alphabetically.
    - SelectMany: selector must now return an ARRAY reference; returning any
          other type dies with "SelectMany: selector must return an ARRAY
          reference".  Previously non-ARRAY values were passed through
          silently (behaving like Select).
    - Distinct: without a key_selector, hash references and array references
          are now compared by content (via internal _make_key), consistent
          with Intersect and Except.  Previously compared by reference
          address (stringification), so structurally equal hashrefs were
          not deduplicated.
    - iterator(): enhanced to support _factory-based re-iteration, enabling
          GroupJoin inner groups to be iterated multiple times.
    - FirstOrDefault / LastOrDefault: fixed critical bug where a single
          non-CODE argument was treated as a predicate, causing a crash.
          A scalar argument is now correctly used as the default value.
    - LastOrDefault: added optional $default argument to match the
          FirstOrDefault([$predicate,] $default) signature.

    Documentation:
    - ARCHITECTURE: Method Categories replaced by a 54-row
          Lazy/Materialising table (Evaluation + Returns columns).
    - ARCHITECTURE: Memory Characteristics updated to match the table.
    - COMPATIBILITY: new ".NET LINQ Compatibility" section listing exact
          matches and intentional differences (SingleOrDefault, DefaultIfEmpty,
          OrderBy smart comparison, EqualityComparer, query syntax).
    - Ordering Methods: section header added explaining stable sort
          (Perl 5.8+ guarantee) and the three comparison families.
    - Set Operations: section header documenting partially-eager evaluation
          (second sequence buffered at call time).
    - Join Operations: section header documenting partially-eager evaluation
          (inner sequence buffered at call time).
    - GroupBy: note updated: "insertion order" replacing "sorted key order".
    - LIMITATIONS: "GroupBy Sorts Keys" entry removed (no longer true).
    - FromLTSV: file-handle management note added.
    - Where DSL: explicit note that arguments must be even-count key=>value pairs.
    - COOKBOOK: two new patterns: "Iterator consumption / snapshot" and
          "Efficient large-file pattern".
    - SelectMany: Important note updated to reflect die behaviour.
    - DIAGNOSTICS: new entry "SelectMany: selector must return an ARRAY
          reference"; FromLTSV entry expanded with file-handle note.
    - DESIGN PHILOSOPHY: new section (Perl 5.005_03 compatibility rationale,
          US-ASCII only policy, $VERSION idiom, design principles).
    - Method count: 50 -> 54.

    Tests:
    - t/004_grouping.t: 8 tests -> 16 tests.
          Added: GroupBy insertion order (3 tests),
                 Distinct content-equality for hashrefs/arrayrefs (5 tests).
    - t/005_complex.t: 10 tests -> 14 tests.
          Added: SelectMany dies on non-ARRAY return (2 tests),
                 SelectMany empty/mixed arrayref (2 tests).
    - t/012_v103_ordering.t: new file, 40 tests.
          Covers OrderByStr, OrderByStrDescending, OrderByNum,
          OrderByNumDescending; stable sort; smart vs Str vs Num contrast;
          LTSV realistic scenarios; edge cases.
    - Total: 246 -> 258 tests across 12 files.
