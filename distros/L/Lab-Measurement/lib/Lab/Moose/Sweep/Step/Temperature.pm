=head1 NAME

Lab::Moose::Sweep::Step::Temperature - Step/list sweep of temperature

=head1 VERSION

version 3.931

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 my $sweep = sweep(
     type => 'Step::Temperature',
     instrument => $oi_triton,
     from => 0.010, # K
     to => 0.5,
     step => 0.05, # K

     # stabilizer options (details in Lab::Moose::Stabilizer)
     tolerance_setpoint => 0.01,
     tolerance_std_dev => 0.01,
     measurement_interval => 1,
     observation_time => 10,
     ...
 );

=head1 Description

Step sweep of temperature. 

Set the temperature with instrument's C<set_T> method; use 
L<Lab::Moose::Stabilizer> to wait until temperature has converged to the
setpoint.
