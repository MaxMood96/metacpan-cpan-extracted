=head1 NAME

Langertha::Role::Seed - Role for an engine that can set a seed

=head1 VERSION

version 0.302

=head2 randomize_seed

When true, a random seed is generated for each request. Defaults to C<0>
(disabled). Useful when you want varied outputs without setting a fixed seed.

=head2 seed

Fixed integer seed for reproducible outputs. Optional. When set, the engine
passes it to the API to make sampling deterministic. Use C<randomize_seed>
instead when you want a different random seed on each call.

=head2 random_seed

    my $seed = $engine->random_seed;

Returns a random unsigned integer suitable for use as a seed value.
