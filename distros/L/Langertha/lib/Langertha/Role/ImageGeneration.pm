=head1 NAME

Langertha::Role::ImageGeneration - Role for engines that support image generation

=head1 VERSION

version 0.302

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Engines that can generate images consume this role. It requires
C<image_request> and C<simple_image> methods, and provides an
C<image_model> attribute.

=head2 image_model

The model name to use for image generation requests. Lazily defaults to
C<default_image_model> if the engine provides it, otherwise falls back
to the general C<model> attribute from L<Langertha::Role::Models>.
