Langertha::Role::Temperature - Role for an engine that can have a temperature setting

=head1 VERSION

version 0.302

=head2 temperature

Sampling temperature as a number. Higher values (e.g. C<0.9>) make output more
random; lower values (e.g. C<0.1>) make it more focused and deterministic. When
not set, the engine's API default is used.
