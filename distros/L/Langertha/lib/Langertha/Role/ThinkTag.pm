=head1 NAME

Langertha::Role::ThinkTag - Configurable think tag filtering for reasoning models

=head1 VERSION

version 0.201

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # Think tag filter is enabled by default on all engines.
    # <think> tags are automatically stripped and thinking preserved:
    my $response = $engine->simple_chat('Explain quantum computing');
    say $response;                  # clean answer text
    say $response->thinking;        # chain-of-thought (if any)

    # For APIs with native reasoning (DeepSeek, Anthropic, Gemini),
    # thinking is extracted from the API response automatically —
    # no tag filtering needed.

    # Custom tag name (e.g. for models using <reasoning> tags):
    my $engine = Langertha::Engine::vLLM->new(
        url       => $vllm_url,
        model     => 'my-reasoning-model',
        think_tag => 'reasoning',
    );

    # Disable filtering if you want raw output:
    my $engine = Langertha::Engine::OpenAI->new(
        api_key          => $key,
        think_tag_filter => 0,
    );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This role provides automatic filtering of C<E<lt>thinkE<gt>> tags from LLM
responses. Many reasoning models (DeepSeek R1, QwQ, Hermes with reasoning
enabled) emit chain-of-thought reasoning wrapped in C<E<lt>thinkE<gt>> tags
inline with their response text. This role strips those tags and preserves
the thinking content on the L<Langertha::Response/thinking> attribute.

Composed into L<Langertha::Role::Chat>, so every engine gets it automatically.
The filter handles both closed pairs (C<E<lt>thinkE<gt>...E<lt>/thinkE<gt>>)
and unclosed tags where the model stopped mid-thought.

For APIs that provide reasoning content natively (DeepSeek C<reasoning_content>,
Anthropic C<thinking> blocks, Gemini C<thought> parts), the thinking is
extracted directly from the API response — no tag filtering needed.

=head2 think_tag

The XML tag name used for thinking content. Defaults to C<think>.
Some models may use different tag names (e.g. C<reasoning>).

=head2 think_tag_filter

When true, C<E<lt>thinkE<gt>...E<lt>/thinkE<gt>> blocks are stripped from
response text. The thinking content is preserved on the
L<Langertha::Response/thinking> attribute for inspection. Defaults to C<1>
(enabled). Set to C<0> to pass think tags through unmodified.

=head2 filter_think_content

    my ($filtered_text, $thinking) = $engine->filter_think_content($text);

Strips C<E<lt>thinkE<gt>...E<lt>/thinkE<gt>> blocks from C<$text>. Handles
both closed pairs and unclosed tags (where the model stopped mid-thought).
Returns the filtered text and the extracted thinking content (or C<undef> if
none). Returns the original text unchanged when L</think_tag_filter> is false.
