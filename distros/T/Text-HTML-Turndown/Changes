    * Add helper shorthand function C<html2markdown>

0.06 2025-04-12
    * Don't generate Markdown for empty links as in
      <a href="https://example.com"></a>
      Such empty link tags are created by Markdown::Perl for text such as
      [https://example.com] , if automatic link generation is on
      (it generates <a ...><a ...></a></a> , and browsers turn the outer link
      into an empty link, as links cannot be nested)

0.05 2025-04-10
    * Handle newlines in table cells
      We convert them into <br/> , as Markdown tables don't really handle newlines

0.04 2025-02-10
    * Fix compatibility with Perl between 5.20 and 5.24

0.03 2025-02-09
    * fix HTML entities in the test suite - different libxml2 versions handle
      unencoded entities differently, leading to test failures
    . Test suite only change, no need to upgrade

0.02 2025-02-07
    * declare that we use postderef in some locations, no other code changes

0.01 2025-01-19
    * Released on an unsuspecting world
