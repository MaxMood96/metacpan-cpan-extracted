0.01		  Fri Sep  5 07:50:43 2025
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.23 with options
		-Xn Text::Fab

	A lot of technical work on the stub implementation, documentation and the test suite was passed to Gemini 2.5 Pro
		(with 32K thinking budget + very delicate system instructions).

	The implementation supports the most basic parts of processing pipeline only.  Only the pure-config__* subsystem is
	covered by the test suite.
