Text-Fab (as of version 0.01)
=============================

Text::Fab - A powerful, general-purpose document expansion framework
(currently exists mostly as uncomplete documentation and a beginning
of a stub of implementation).

Its purpose is to factor out THE COMMON NEEDS of all the
configurable-on-the-fly document processing engines; more precisely, it
focuses on the needs orthogonal to the particular syntax of a particular
problem domain.  (The architecture aims to overcome the experiences with
designing “simple” configurable systems — which turn out to be not
scalable, so all the approaches to make them operable crumble under their
own weight.)

In short: this attempts to abstract out all the complexity of scalable
configurability.  The resulting “tools” support architecture with a
top→down approach to recognizing the “reconfiguration directives”.

A README file is required for CPAN modules since CPAN extracts the
README file from a module distribution so that people browsing the
archive can use it get an idea of the modules uses. It is usually a
good idea to provide version information here so that people can
decide whether fixes for the module are worth downloading.
