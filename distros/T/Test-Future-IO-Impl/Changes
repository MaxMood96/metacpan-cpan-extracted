Revision history for Test-Future-IO-Impl

0.20    2026-02-27
        [BUGFIXES]
         * Improved testing around `POLLHUP`-related tests

0.19    2026-02-11
        [BUGFIXES]
         * Don't expect exactly `POLLERR` for the hangup-out test case, as
           OSes differ in exact behaviour here

0.18    2026-02-09
        [CHANGES]
         * Additionally tests that `->poll(POLLIN)` doesn't accidentally fire
           on POLLOUT-only handle

        [BUGFIXES]
         * Improvements to `connect` tests that might reduce false negatives
           on Windows and other platforms

0.17    2026-01-18
        [CHANGES]
         * Added tests for `poll` method

        [BUGFIXES]
         * Account for the fact that read or write IO operations may have
           already happened before they are cancelled
         * Clear the EAGAIN error from `$wr` filehandle in EAGAIN write test
           to stop perl writing annoying warnings during test

0.16    2026-01-07
        [BUGFIXES]
         * Be less sensitive to `->send` failure in peer-closed case, as OS
           behaviour differs here
         * sleep() unconditionally after closing listening server in connect
           test, as most OSes need it. 100msec is sufficient

0.15    2025-07-15
        [CHANGES]
         * Added tests for `send`, `recv` and `recvfrom` methods
         * Provide copies of `sysread` and `syswrite` tests named `read` and
           `write`

0.14    2023-04-25
        [CHANGES]
         * Split from Future-IO distribution
