NAME

    Test::Future::IO::Impl - acceptance tests for Future::IO
    implementations

SYNOPSIS

       use Test::More;
       use Test::Future::IO::Impl;
    
       use Future::IO;
       use Future::IO::Impl::MyNewImpl;
    
       run_tests 'sleep';
    
       done_testing;

DESCRIPTION

    This module contains a collection of acceptance tests for
    implementations of Future::IO.

FUNCTIONS

 run_tests

       run_tests @suitenames;

    Runs a collection of tests against Future::IO. It is expected that the
    caller has already loaded the specific implementation module to be
    tested against before this function is called.

TEST SUITES

    The following test suite names may be passed to the "run_tests"
    function:

 accept

    Tests the Future::IO->accept method.

 connect

    Tests the Future::IO->connect method.

 recv, recvfrom

    Since version 0.15.

    Tests the Future::IO->recv and Future::IO->recvfrom methods.

 send

    Since version 0.15.

    Tests the Future::IO->send method.

 sleep

    Tests the Future::IO->sleep method.

 read, sysread

    Tests the Future::IO->sysread or Future::IO->sysread method.

    These two test suites are identical other than the name of the method
    they invoke. The two exist because of the method rename that happened
    at Future::IO version 0.17.

 write, syswrite

    Tests the Future::IO->write or Future::IO->syswrite method.

    These two test suites are identical other than the name of the method
    they invoke. The two exist because of the method rename that happened
    at Future::IO version 0.17.

 waitpid

    Tests the Future::IO->waitpid method.
