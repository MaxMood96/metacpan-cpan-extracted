Revision history for Net-HTTP2-nghttp2

0.004   2026-02-08
        - submit_response() body parameter now accepts CODE ref (previously
          only data_callback parameter was supported for streaming)
        - Fix submit_data() to work correctly by reusing existing data provider
          instead of creating a new one (avoids nghttp2 assertion failure)
        - Add submit_data test suite (t/21-submit-data.t)
        - Document all public methods and callbacks in Session.pm POD
        - Fix author placeholder in POD

0.003   2026-02-08
        - Support streaming body callback in submit_request() for client-side
          bidirectional streams (e.g. Extended CONNECT / WebSocket over HTTP/2)
        - submit_request() body parameter now accepts CODE ref in addition to
          string; callback receives ($stream_id, $max_length) and returns
          ($data, $eof_flag) or undef to defer
        - Add streaming request test suite (t/20-streaming-request.t)
