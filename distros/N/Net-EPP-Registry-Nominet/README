Net::EPP::Registry::Nominet 0.12

Released: 21st August 2025


INSTALLATION
------------

To install this module you can follow the usual procedure which is:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

Note that most of the tests will be skipped unless you provide a tag and
a password for connection to the Nominet EPP Testbed. See
http://registrars.nominet.org.uk/registration-and-domain-management/registrar-systems/epp/testbed
for details of how to register for the testbed. Before running "make
test", set up the environment variables NOMTAG and NOMPASS like so:

	export NOMTAG=MYTAG NOMPASS=mypass

If you have the CPAN module installed then you can install the module
from the command line like so:

	$ cpan Net::EPP::Registry::Nominet


DESCRIPTION
-----------

Net::EPP::Registry::Nominet is designed to allow synchronous management
of .uk domains.

This module extends Net::EPP::Simple to cope with the unorthodox EPP
implementation currently in use by Nominet, the registry with
responsibility for the .uk namespace. It is intended to have a
compatible interface to Net::EPP::Simple so far as is practical.
