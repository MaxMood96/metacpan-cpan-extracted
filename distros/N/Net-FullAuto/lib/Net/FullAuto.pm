=head1 FullAuto Framework (Coming Soon) Synopsis (Beta/Experimental)

=over 4

The FullAuto Framework utilizes the C<fa> command line utility. Limited functionality is already available, and is documented in various sections below. Only the "Framework" is experimental. FullAuto itself is fully released. The rest of the documentation describes fully released FullAuto functionality. See the L<Coming Soon|/Coming Soon> section below for more information on the FullAuto Framework and other features currently in development. You can preview elements of the FullAuto Framework with this command:

   fa --new-user

Using Term::Menus, the FullAuto "new user experience" demonstrates how a command environment solution (which is or should be the domain of most distributed workload automation) can be I<self-documenting>, without the need, overhead and cost of a web (or any other GUI) infrastructure. Self-documenting solutions are particularly needed for automated processes, because when they work I<properly>, an automated solution can go months or even years without a human examining it in detail - often long after the orginal implementers have left the organization. This is the first "page" of the "new user experience":

=head1 Description

C<Net::FullAuto>S<  > (aka C<FullAuto>) is a Perl module and workload automation functionality that transforms Perl into a true multi-host scripting language. It accomplishes this with multiple B<*PERSISTENT*> SSH and SFTP connections to multiple hosts simultaneously. With FullAuto entire hosts are encapsulated in a single filehandle. Think of each filehandle as an always available SSH client (like PuTTY) and SFTP client (like WinSCP) that are available I<programmatically> to the script.

The importance of I<persistent> connections when attempting to programmatically control remote hosts cannot be over stated. Essentially, it means that FullAuto can "fully" automate just about B<EVERYTHING>.

To see FullAuto in action, please download and explore the "Self Service Demonstration" at L<http://sourceforge.net/projects/fullauto>. The demo contains an embedded YouTube video (L<https://youtu.be/gRwa1QoOS7M>) explaining and showing the entire automated process of setting up a complex multi-host infrastructure in the Amazon EC2 Cloud. After watching or while watching the video, you can run the demo and standup your own cloud infrastructure in just a few minutes.

The Hadoop demo is particularly interesting and timely given the recent explosion of BIG DATA and the need to access it more powerfully. The Hadoop demo utilizes a special FullAuto L<Instruction Set|http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/REEDFISH/Net-FullAuto-1.0000824/lib/Net/FullAuto/ISets/Amazon/Hadoop_is.pm>" that stands up a complete 4 node/server cluster in the Amazon EC2 Cloud. Every element of the build and stand up is automated including using the EC2 API to launch servers, connecting to all 4 servers automatically with SSH & SFTP, downloading and compiling Hadoop source code from L<http://hadoop.apache.org|http://hadoop.apache.org>, downloading and installing Java and all other dependencies, and then cross-configuring all 4 nodes with discovered IP addresses and other information that was unknown at the beginning of the standup - and finally starting the cluster and launching an admin web portal.

Imagine a scripting language that can essentially turn an entire network of computers into a truly interactive collective. This is precisely what FullAuto does.

FullAuto utilizesS<  >C<ssh>S<  >andS<  >C<sftp>S<  >(can also useS<  >C<telnet>S<  >andS<  >C<ftp>, though for security reasons, this is NOT recommended) to bring the command environments of any number of remote computers (Operating System of remote computer does not matter), together in one convenient scripting space. With FullAuto, you write code once, on one computer, and have it execute on multiple computers simultaneously, in an interactive dynamic fashion, as if the many computers were truly one.

How is FullAuto different from programs like Chef (http://www.chef.io) and Puppet (http://www.puppetlabs.com) and Ansible (http://www.ansible.com) and Salt (http://www.saltstack.com)? All of which assert the same ability and functionality?

Chef and Puppet and Salt require the use of agents on remote hosts. FullAuto has no such dependency, as it is agent-less. It works against any SSH server implementation on any operating system. Ansible claims to be "agent-less" but actually has a dependency on the Python scripting language being available on the remote host, as well as requiring that the OpenSSH daemon on remote nodes be configured to utilize the ControlPersist feature. FullAuto has no such dependency (FullAuto does not even require Perl on the remote nodes), and if any manual terminal program or utility can connect to a device viaS<  >C<ssh>S<  >orS<  >C<sftp>S<  >orS<  >C<scp>S<  >or evenS<  >C<telnet>S<  >orS<  >C<ftp>,S<  >FullAuto can connect as well - persistently.

FullAuto goes beyond these packages in its unique ability to L<PROXY-CHAIN|/Proxy> multiple hosts with the same persistent connection capability. This means, without agents or any special configuration, FullAuto can L<proxy|/proxy> connect through any number of hosts and navigate multiple network segments to get you to the host and data you need - in REAL time! Real time interactive command channels and data feeds are the next "big thing", but till now have been incredibly difficult to setup, maintain and keep secure (not to mention "expensive"). With FullAuto, it is now possible for a single ssh process to proxy out through a firewall to a box in the DMZ, from that host go any distance across the internet to another ssh host in another organization's DMZ, proxy through that host and through the firewall, and continue navigating proxies until the process arrives at the host, functionality and data it needs. For additional security, the destination organization can also use FullAuto to host a real time "SSH Service API" (similar to web services) and allow a distant process controlled and precise access to hosts and data just as is provided with web services - without the burden of certificates, https, tokens, etc. - and with better performance (due to the simplicity and direct connect capability of FullAuto's architecture). Web services are still predominantly "stateless" due to the architecture of the http protocol. FullAuto is state-FULL, insuring the most direct access to remote host functionality and data imaginable - regardless of application. Moreover, because FullAuto proxy connections are lightweight, proxy hosts in DMZ environments can do double duty as "honey pots" - which themselves can be stood up, fully configured and fully managed automatically by FullAuto. (L<See the 'proxy' configuration element - below|/Proxy>).

FullAuto can be run by a user in a Menu driven, interactive mode (using the L<Term::Menus|http://search.cpan.org/dist/Term-Menus/lib/Term/Menus.pm> module - also written by Brian Kelly), or via UNIX or Linux C<cron> or Windows Scheduler or Cygwin C<cron> in a fully automated fashion.

Example: A user needs to pull data from a database, put it in a text file, zip and encrypt it, and then transfer that file to another computer on the other side of the world via the internet - in one-step.

Assume FullAuto is installed on computer one, the database is on computer two, and the remote computer in Japan is computer three. When the user starts the script using C<Net::FullAuto>, FullAuto will connect via C<ssh> and C<sftp> (simultaneously) to computer two, and via C<sftp> to computer three. Using a sql command utility on computer two, data can be extracted and piped to a text file on computer two. Then, FullAuto will run the command for a C<zip> utility over C<ssh> on computer two to compress the file. Next (assume the encryption software is on computer one) FullAuto will transfer this file to computer one, where it can be encrypted with licensed encryption software, and then finally, the encrypted file can be transferred to computer three via C<sftp>. Email and pager software can be used for automated notification as well.

Example: The same process above needs to run at 2:00am unattended.

A script using FullAuto can be run via C<cron> (or any other scheduler) to perform the same actions above without user involvement.

Each individual command run on a remote computer returns to FullAuto STDOUT (output) and STDERR (error messages) and command exit codes. With these features, users and programmers can write code to essentially trap remote errors "locally" and respond with any number of error recovery approaches. Everything from sending an e-mail, to re-running the command, to switching remote computers and much more is available as error handling options. The only limits are the skills and ingenuity of the programmers and administrators using FullAuto. If FullAuto loses a connection to a remote host, automatic attempts will be made to re-connect seamlessly - with errors reported when the configured maximum numbers of attempts fail.

Connecting to a remote host is as simple as:

 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

 use Net::FullAuto;

 my $remote_host_info={

      Label => 'Remote Host',
      Hostname => $ip_or_hostname,
      Login => $username,
      IdentityFile => $identity_file,  # can leave out if password or
                                       # or key-based login is used
      # Password => $password,         # can leave out if identity file
                                       # or key-based login is used
 };

 my $remote_host_handle=connect_ssh($remote_host_info);

 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Commands also are easy:

 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

 my ($stdout,$stderr,$exitcode)=$remote_host_handle->cmd('ls -l');

 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

In addition, no cleanup is necessary - FullAuto handles cleanup I<automatically>.

FullAuto uses C<ssh> and C<sftp> for communication across hosts and devices. FullAuto connections can be configured to use password-less key exchange.

=head1 Reasons to Use this Module

To do everything you could do with other workload automation packages like Chef, Puppet, Anisble and Salt without the cost, overhead and resource requirements of those solutions. To go beyond those packages and set up real-time ssh proxy-chained interactive command channels and data feeds. To do L<Managed File Transfers|/"Managed File Transfers"> via sftp or insecure ftp without having to impose requirements on owners of remote host servers. To have an entire workload automation encapsulated in a single L<Instruction Set|/Instruction Sets> that often is so tiny; it can easily be attached to an email. You need a solution that is as easy to install as C<install Net::FullAuto>. You want the entire CPAN available for use in your L<Instruction Sets|/Instruction Sets>. You want the true strengths of Perl and the Perl Community and features like Perl's unsurpassed regular expression functionality readily available. You want the flexibility of a serial scripting language, and the option to use modern OO programming with Moose. A solution that can work equally well on both UNIX/Linux and Windows operating systems (FullAuto works on Windows within the Cygwin Linux layer for Windows environment).

FullAuto is the SIMPLEST and most direct path to Full Automation (hence the name). That path is to make full use of trusted connectivity components already in widespread use on billions of devices the world over. SSH and SFTP are literally on every UNIX and Linux host in the world - and are both easily added to MS Windows. SSH and SFTP are used to connect to multiple network devices such as routers and switches. SSH and SFTP are a widely available means to connect to the Mainframe. All we EVER needed was an automation solution that simply utilized this widespread access architecture already in place - AS IS, without requiring any special features or configuration. That solution is now a reality - and its name is B<FullAuto>.

=head3 Label

=over 4

=item

C<Label =E<gt> E<lt>labelE<gt>,>

This element contains the label to identify the host.

=back

=head3 Hostname

=over 4

=item

C<Hostname =E<gt> E<lt>hostnameE<gt>,>

This element contains the hostname of the host. It can also be encoded with an ip address as no validation is done.

=back

=head3 IP

=over 4

=item

C<IP =E<gt> E<lt>ip addressE<gt>,>

This element contains the ip address of the host. It can also be encoded with a hostname as no validation is done.

=back

=head3 Use

=over 4

=item

C<Use =E<gt> E<lt>hostname|ipE<gt>,>

This element is used when both a hostname and ip address are included in C<%connection_info>. It is used to indicate which to "use" first - hostname or ip address. FullAuto will use try the hostname first, if both hostname and ip address are configured, and C<Use> is not used.

=back

=head3 Password

=over 4

=item

C<Password =E<gt> E<lt>passwordE<gt>,>

This element contains the password to use when logging in. You are strongly advised NOT to use this element, as clear text passwords are VERY insecure! Rather, use keys or identityfiles to authenticate against remote ssh/sftp servers.

=back

=head3 IdentityFile

=over 4

=item

C<IdentityFile =E<gt> E<lt>path to identityfileE<gt>,>

This element contains the path to the identityfile used to login to the remote host. If you are not already authenticating with this approach, you are STRONGLY encouraged to consider doing so. Clear text passwords are notoriously unsafe.

=back

=head3 Log

=over 4

=item

C<Log =E<gt> E<lt>1|0|path_to_logfileE<gt>,>

FullAuto has built in logging, but in order to use it, it must be explicitly turned on. It can be turned on and off in C<%connection_info> using this element. A custom logfile and location can be indicated rather than a '1' which simply turns it on. The default location for FullAuto logs is C</home/E<lt>userE<gt>/.fullauto/logs>. FullAuto does NOT have one big log, but rather creates an entirely new log for each script/Instruction Set invocation. This is a typical example: C<FA9320d031717h14m13s19.log> The naming convention of the file is as follows.

 FA        -> identifies this as a FullAuto log file
 9320      -> PID (Process ID) of the FullAuto process to which this log belongs
 d031717   -> Date of the log: March 17, 2017
 h14m13s19 -> h: hour 14 (2pm) m: 13 minutes s: 19 seconds

FullAuto logging is turned on by default when using the FullAuto Framework (C<fa> commandline executable). In addition to the log just described, a stdout file C<OUTPUT.txt> is also created in the same folder as the log. Each process overwrites this file.

Both files are placed in a zip file (C<fa_logs.zip>) in the current directory. Each process overwrites this file as well.

To turn off this behavior set the C<$save_fa_logs_dot_zip_in_current_directory> variable to zero '0' in the C<fa_conf.pm> configuration file. Use C<fa -V> to find the location.

It is advised that a stream of continuous output be provided if possible. Examine the options of commands you will be using, and use verbose or debug options if output is ordinarily light. When calling custom scripts - make sure those scripts provide output that comes continuously or at least within the 90-second timeout.

The <code>_cmd_handle</code> element contains the process handle GLOB. This is a Net::Telnet handle as the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~jrogers/Net-Telnet-3.04/lib/Net/Telnet.pm">Net::Telnet</a> module from CPAN is used to actually connect to a spawned local shell (bash) process, that is then used to launch SSH and SFTP sessions. Don't let the name "Net::Telnet" confuse you - when <code>connect_secure()</code> and other FullAuto secure connect methods are used, the actual clear text and insecure <i>'telnet'</i> protocol is <b>*NOT*</b> being used! SSH and SFTP are being used instead. Net::Telnet can be used as a lightweight "Expect" and that is precisely how it is used in the internals of Net::FullAuto. As such, all the features and methods of Net::Telnet are available within this handle. There are times when it is very useful to access some of Net::Telnet's methods directly and bypass FullAuto's input and output manipulations. When doing so, you will have to account for the output artifacts that FullAuto handles for you, but there are occasions where this is desirable - especially when front-ending and automating interactive command line programs that prompt the user. Examples of this are provided later in the documentation. So just what does FullAuto provide that Net::Telnet does not? For starters, Net::Telnet requires you to know the prompt of each remote host you want to connect and interact with. This sounds like a simple requirement, but in actual practice, this requirement is a MAJOR headache. The truth is, prompts are very dynamic artifacts that change from host to host, shell to shell, user to user, and can and do change without notice. Prompt changes are one of the most common reasons automated workloads break! FullAuto dynamically discovers the prompt for you on login, eliminating this requirement altogether - and making your job of automating processes significantly easier. FullAuto enables you to access correct output, error output from STDERR, and command exit codes with each command sent. Net::Telnet alone does not provide this kind of advanced functionality. FullAuto automatically handles echoed prompts and other telnet protocol line noise, relieving the user of having to deal with any of it. Many users over the years have attempted to use Net::Telnet the way they <b>CAN</b> use FullAuto, without understanding and appreciating Net::Telnet's limitations and the actual knowledge and skill needed to use Net::Telnet successfully. The goal of the FullAuto project was to essentially remove nearly all of Net::Telnet's limitations, and allow users to automate workloads as they would intuitively expect they should be able to - like they would do it manually in PuTTY for instance, but <i>programmatically </i> instead. A user can successfully use FullAuto without needing a deep dive into the documentation, and without a big learning curve - unlike when trying to use Net::Telnet alone. FullAuto also provides process locking - a necessary feature when automating large and complex workloads.<br><br>Net::Telnet methods can be accessed in the following manner:<br><br><code>$connect_secure_object-&gt;{_cmd_handle}-&gt;print();</code>

The <b>cmd()</b> method is the "centerpiece" of FullAuto. This is the one method you will use at least 80% of the time. It is as close to a full "command environment" encapsulated in one handle as could be imagined. Just about anything you could do manually with a shell terminal or program like PuTTY, you can do just as easily with this method. The most important attribute of this method, and of FullAuto itself, is its use of a <b>*PERSISTENT*</b> connection to the remote host. Because of this approach, STATE is persisted among invocations of this method throughout the life cycle of the Instruction Set. In simpler terms, if you change a directory IT STAYS CHANGED. If you add or modify an environment variable, IT STAYS MODIFIED for the next call of the <code>cmd()</code> method. If you do a <code>su</code> or <code>sudo su</code>, the session will remain persistent until you exit. (One caveat - <code>su</code> usage is the one time you will have to account for the prompt and set it yourself). It is this single attribute (persistent connection) that suddenly makes workload automation <b>EASY</b>.<br><br>NOTE: While this does work:<br><br><code>($ssh_cmd_output,$error,$exitcode) = $connect_secure_object->cmd('cd /etc')</code><br><br>It is better to use the FullAuto <code>cwd()</code> method for all file system navigation.

The B<cmd()> method has two other optional arguments

=head3 timeout

=begin html

<P CLASS="indented">
The default timeout value for the <code>cmd()</code> method is 90 seconds. You can change this
by specifying a timeout value parameter in seconds:<br><br>
The timeout setting is important only with long running commands that do not produce output. As long as a command produces output, the timeout value will not come into play. The command can run literally forever - as long as there is continuous output. It is advised that if you have any control over the output of the command, to enable a sufficient amount of output to avoid having to use the timeout argument. If the command has a "verbose" option, consider activating it. The tradeoff is that supplying output rather than a timeout value increases reliability, and allows the <code>cmd('&lt;command&gt;')</code> to end whenever it needs to - regardless of how long it takes. However, output is "expensive" and to get the quickest return time, using a timeout might produce faster results. But know that you are intentionally choosing speed over reliability, and speed always carries an increased risk.<br><br>
<code>($cmd_output,$error,$exitcode) = $connect_secure_object->cmd('&lt;command&gt;',&lt;seconds&gt;)</code>

It can appear before any timeout value, or after. <code>'__display__'</code> is a very useful feature for debugging, as well as for processes that human eyes will be anxiously watching closely. Output is "comforting", heals "blank screen anxiety" and allows stakeholders to relax and know that things are working. However, printing output to the screen has costs and slows down processing - significantly. Therefore, unless you really need to see output, it's best not to set this.<br><br>

There are occasions where a command simply has too many special symbols, quotes, escapes, etc; where no amount of manipulation can get it through FullAuto's input validation correctly. In these cases, sending it through the <code>cmd_raw()</code> method and bypassing all of FullAuto's special handling logic can occasionally produce the desired result. Usually this will work when there is no output, or the output can be discarded. For the most reliable and robust processing, always try to use <code>cmd()</code> as much as possible, saving <code>cmd_raw()</code> as a method of last resort.

Unlike most other workload automation packages, persistent connection is the one feature that truly sets FullAuto apart. One of the biggest problems there is when a connection is not persistent, is maintaining "state" between commands. When the connection is not persistent, the environment must be updated along with each command sent. This is huge burden on developers, is resource intensive, and makes workload automation extraordinarily complex and fragile. This is precisely why most workload automation packages like 'Chef', 'Puppet', 'Salt' and others are Client-Server architecture - requiring agents on all remote hosts/nodes. 'Ansible' is dependent on the "ControlPersist" feature of OpenSSH. The problem with the "ControlPersist" feature is that not all SSH servers are OpenSSH, or a recent version of OpenSSH. FullAuto has NO such dependency and will work with ANY SSH server or version of SSH server known to the author. Also, (s)ftp servers <code>cwd</code> and <code>lcd</code> commands do not support common Unix/Linux shell navigation syntax such as '<code>~</code>' for one button access to the user's home directory. However, when using the <code>cwd()</code> method supplied with FullAuto, this syntax is fully supported for both the command and (s)ftp environments. The importance of this becomes apparent when you start coding up large and complex  L<Instruction Sets|/Instruction Sets> . The ability to use one single method to change the path location in both environments simultaneously, and to navigate PRECISELY as you would as if you were using a manual terminal like PuTTY, or within any Unix/Linux shell environment, makes it easy for ANYONE who works with these tools regularly to use FullAuto successfully without needing advanced programming language skills or any significant learning curve.

FullAuto has built in logging, but in order to use it, it must be explicitly turned on. It can be turned on and off anywhere in the script/Instruction Set using this method. A custom logfile and location can be indicated rather than a '1' which simply turns it on. The default location for FullAuto logs is C</home/E<lt>userE<gt>/.fullauto/logs>. FullAuto does NOT have one big log, but rather creates an entirely new log for each script/Instruction Set invocation. This is a typical example: C<FA9320d031717h14m13s19.log> The naming convention of the file is as follows.

 FA        -> identifies this as a FullAuto log file
 9320      -> PID (Process ID) of the FullAuto process for which this log belongs
 d031717   -> Date of the log: March 17, 2017

=head1 Instruction Sets

A FullAuto Instruction Set is actually a Perl module that utilizes FullAuto to perform a very specific type of operation. There is very little difference between a "script" that uses FullAuto, and an Instruction Set. An Instruction Set is simply a way of packaging a FullAuto script for distribution within the under development FullAuto Framework. The goal is that someday there will be a vast library of Instruction Set modules that can be downloaded and used to provide specific and tailored automated solutions for a wide spectrum of use cases and applications. The Instruction Set framework is something that can also be used to package proprietary instructions that can be even be sold for profit within a planned "FullAuto Marketplace". Soon, with the upcoming launch of the FullAuto Web Service API, FullAuto Instruction Sets can be written in I<any> programming or scripting language that can utilize RESTful Web Services. Currently there are 5 Instruction Sets bundled with FullAuto (and which will be released as stand-alone Perl modules in the near future):

Currently, the included Instruction Sets only work on Amazon EC2, but will be extended to work on other public clouds and even private environments in the near future. You can run these Instruction Sets yourself with the Windows "Self Service Demonstration" helper app at L<http://sourceforge.net/projects/fullauto> or from Linux with the FullAuto Framework. Be sure to stand up a micro server in EC2 first, and install FullAuto with cpan. Full instructions for setting up EC2 are in the YouTube video L<https://youtu.be/gRwa1QoOS7M>. Then from the command line of the Linux FullAuto micro server, run the following command:

   fa --iset-amazon

Be sure to follow the onscreen instructions.

=head1 Installation

=head2 Linux/Unix and Cygwin (for Windows) command line installation

FullAuto is installed with Perl's C<cpan> command line utility. At C<cpan> prompt, type: C<install Net::FullAuto>

The FullAuto install is a bit different than other CPAN module installations. Normally C<cpan> will NOT update a dependency module if it already exists on the system - even if it is an older version. It also will NOT remove the same module found in more than one location, even if the old one has precedence in @INC - meaning it will always load the old one. FullAuto does not work with "local::lib" - so this install will update all dependencies (over 100 of them) and remove any duplicates. If this is not acceptable, then do not install FullAuto on hosts, or in a Perl installation, where module updates can be an issue. A highly recommended approach, is to install/build a separate Perl on these hosts, and install FullAuto there.

=head2 FullAuto Windows Installer

FullAuto for Microsoft Windows has a dependency on L<Cygwin|http://cygwin.com>. Since Cygwin setup and configuration can be complex, a turn-key FullAuto Windows Installer was created that installs Cygwin and all other dependencies needed to run FullAuto on a Windows host. The FullAuto Windows Installer can be downloaded here:

L<https://sourceforge.net/projects/fullauto/files/latest/download|https://sourceforge.net/projects/fullauto/files/latest/download>

Download the executable, double click, and follow the onscreen instructions. Be sure to use an account with full Administrative privileges.

=head3 Install minimal Cygwin and OpenSSH Server on Microsoft Windows

The FullAuto Windows Installer contains an option to install a minimal Cygwin installation along with a fully configured OpenSSH service. This is useful for installing a full featured SSH and SFTP service on any Windows host. Such a host can then be accessed by FullAuto via SSH and SFTP and participate in any FullAuto automated workload. When this option is used, FullAuto itself will NOT be installed. Be sure to use an account with full Administrative privileges.

=head1 Examples

The best workload automation examples are the included L<Instruction Sets|/Instruction Sets> (discussed above). Within the bundled modules listed above are code examples to accomplish just about any basic operation one would need to automate just about any workload imaginable. Please review them for assistance and inspiration.

=head2 Managed File Transfers

=over 4

=item

According to Wikipedia, L<Managed File Transfers|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Managed_file_transfer> (MFT) I<"Typically, ... offers a higher level of security and control than FTP. Features include reporting (e.g., notification of successful file transfers), non-repudiation, auditability, global visibility, automation of file transfer-related activities and processes, end-to-end security, and performance metrics/monitoring."> All of these features can be included in a FullAuto implementation of MFT. All transfer output can be optionally logged, including transfer speeds and ETA's. Files can be verified on the remote host with C<ls -l>. The code below is designed to be launched by cron, The number of active processes can be controlled through FullAuto's locking feature. Individual files being actively transferred are locked, and so are writes to the transfer report - even when that report is on a different host and operating system locking mechanisms are not available.

=head2 Automated Builds, Deployments, DevOps and Term::Menus

=over 4

=item

The FullAuto project was started in 2000 in an effort to create a better way to do software builds and deployments. This was back before the word "L<DevOps|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps>" (I<a clipped compound of "development" and "operations">) was even coined. Back then, as it is today, security and domain (or turf) protection was far and away the biggest obstacle to productivity. As necessary as it is, security and departmental boundaries come with a cost. That cost is the compartmentalization of access to an organization's IT infrastructure. It's this compartmentalization and the effort needed to work within it to accomplish project goals that ends up killing more time and productivity than any other single factor. The result is a never-ending "access" tug-of-war where solution producers (developers) vie and lobby for as much as access as possible, while operations tries to limit access to the greatest extent possible. FullAuto was conceived as the ultimate tool to make maximum efficient use of very limited access to organizational infrastructure. Such a tool would have to be "free" because procuring expensive software is difficult. It needed to be "agent-less" because of the politics and difficulty of getting permission to install anything on hosts you did not own or control. It needed to be centralized for efficiency, yet utilize ubiquitous distributed components to the greatest extend possible. Finally, it needed to be "easy" to use so that more traditional system administrators can use it without having to rely on developers or be developers themselves. That is why FullAuto is written in Perl, because even today, system administrators are familiar with it. FullAuto was built to take the workflow of a system administrator's typical task and be able to execute it in an almost identical fashion, with the same shell commands and utilities used manually.

The L<Instruction Sets|/Instruction Sets> listed above are in fact the best examples of DevOps there is. They encompass both automated builds and deployment. They demonstrate the level of true automation that can applied to any workload - especially those that cross departmental boundaries.

There is however, one more element to a successful workload strategy, and that is the need for some kind of I<minimal>, I<lightweight>, yet powerful user interface. FullAuto has a sister module - L<Term::Menus|http://search.cpan.org/dist/Term-Menus/lib/Term/Menus.pm>, also written by Brian Kelly. Originally part of the FullAuto Framework, it was later separated out into its own stand-alone module. No matter how automated a workload is, there is almost always going to be the need for some kind of human input. Today that input comes predominantly in the form of command line parameters and configuration files. It's the customized, poorly documented and non-intuitive nature of these inputs that often makes workloads fragile and error-prone. L<Term::Menus|http://search.cpan.org/dist/Term-Menus/lib/Term/Menus.pm> is a solution to this need. Used within FullAuto scripts and L<Instruction Sets|/Instruction Sets>, Term::Menus enables embedded documentation, user selection and validation that command line parameters and config files do not provide. Term::Menus even provides the kind of powerful <Lforms|http://search.cpan.org/dist/Term-Menus/lib/Term/Menus.pm#FORMS> most would expect to find only in a cumbersome web interface (cumbersome because of the overhead and complexity of putting a web interface in front of anything). Term::Menus is lightweight, easy to program, and even easier to use. Menus built with Term::Menus can hold 2 items or 2 million items - and are searchable. They can be inserted anywhere in any workload - especially long running ones, where human input would otherwise require complete interruption and/or decoupling. This can significantly reduce the need for complex and cumbersome command line parameter and config file based metadata conveyance between disconnected workloads; workloads that can now be unified. With FullAuto and L<Term::Menus|http://search.cpan.org/dist/Term-Menus/lib/Term/Menus.pm> - the number of workloads can be reduced, and the remaining ones simplified to a remarkable degree. With Term::Menus, you can now build powerful command environment user interfaces with search capabilities that rival (and in some ways exceed) anything you can do in a web interface.

To see the just some of the capabilities of L<Term::Menus|http://search.cpan.org/dist/Term-Menus/lib/Term/Menus.pm>, check out the FullAuto Figlet utility:

=head1 Coming Soon

=head2 FullAuto Web Service API

Nearing completion is the FullAuto Web Service API that will enable anyone in any programming or scripting language to access and use the full power and functionality of FullAuto without having to know Perl at all.

=head2 FullAuto Framework Environment

FullAuto will soon have a "Framework" environment accessed with the C<fa> executable. Using this environment, passwords can be stored encrypted in the Berkeley DB database. The FullAuto Framework is an interactive lifecycle environment that will make using FullAuto easier for teams and multiple users. The FullAuto Framework Environment can be previewed now (just follow the onscreen instructions):

 fa --new-user

=head2 The FullAuto MarketPlace

FullAuto L<Instruction Sets|/Instruction Sets> can be created to satisfy big ambitions and small ones. Some of of those solutions can be shared as Open Source, and others will have market value, and can potentially be quite valuable (as well as sensitive). The FullAuto MarketPlace will be an online location where users can shop, preview, research and download and/or purchase FullAuto L<Instruction Sets|/Instruction Sets>. It is anticipated there will someday be Instruction Sets customized for different public clouds and private clouds, different operating systems, infrastructure setup, security monitoring and penetration testing, automated build and deployment tools, as well highly specialized Instruction Sets for different engineering, profiling, data analytics, testing and industrial applications. The possibilities are almost limitless.
