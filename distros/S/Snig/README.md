# NAME

Snig - (Simple|Static|Small|S..) Image Gallery

# VERSION

version 1.001

# SYNOPSIS

Yet another static image HTML photo gallery generator.

I wanted to play with new Perl class syntax instead of learning to configure one of the hundred existings generators, so...

This class is basically only the runner calling [Snig::Collection](https://metacpan.org/pod/Snig%3A%3ACollection). See [snig.pl](https://metacpan.org/pod/snig.pl) for command line opts etc.
