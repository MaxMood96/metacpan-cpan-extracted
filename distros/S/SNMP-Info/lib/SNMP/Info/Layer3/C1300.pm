See L<SNMP::Info::Layer3/"Required MIBs"> for its own MIB requirements.

See L<SNMP::Info::Aggregate/"Required MIBs"> for its own MIB requirements.

See L<SNMP::Info::MAU/"Required MIBs"> for its own MIB requirements.

=head1 GLOBALS

These are methods that return scalar values from SNMP

=over

=item $C1300->vendor()

Returns 'C1300'

=item $C1300->model()

Tries to reference $C1300->id() to one of the product MIBs listed above

Removes 'C1300' from the name for readability.

=item $C1300->os()

Returns 'EOS'

=item $C1300->os_ver()

Grabs the os version from C<sysDescr>

=head2 Global Methods imported from SNMP::Info::MAU

See documentation in L<SNMP::Info::MAU/"GLOBALS"> for details.

=head1 TABLE METHODS

These are methods that return tables of information in the form of a reference
to a hash.

=over

=item $C1300->v_name()

The VLAN Names.

=item $C1300->i_duplex_admin()

Returns info from F<MAU-MIB>

=item $C1300->i_speed_admin()

Returns info from F<MAU-MIB>

=item $C1300->lldp_if()

Returns the mapping to the SNMP Interface Table.

=item C<agg_ports>

Returns a HASH reference mapping from slave to master port for each member of
a port bundle on the device. Keys are ifIndex of the slave ports, Values are
ifIndex of the corresponding master ports.

=head1 SET METHODS

These are methods that provide SNMP set functionality for overridden methods
or provide a simpler interface to complex set operations.  See

operations.
