=head1 NAME

Slack::BlockKit::Block::Section - a Block Kit section block, used to collect text

=head1 VERSION

version 0.005

=head1 OVERVIEW

This represents a C<section> block, which is commonly used to contain text to
be sent.  Don't confuse this class with L<Slack::BlockKit::Block::RichText> or
L<Slack::BlockKit::Block::RichText::Section>, which are used to present I<rich>
text.  A "normal" section block can only present rich text in the form of
C<mrkdwn>-type text objects.

=head1 PERL VERSION

This module should work on any version of perl still receiving updates from
the Perl 5 Porters.  This means it should work on any version of perl
released in the last two to three years.  (That is, if the most recently
released version is v5.40, then this module should work on both v5.40 and
v5.38.)

Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made that the
minimum required version will not be increased.  The version may be increased
for any reason, and there is no promise that patches will be accepted to
lower the minimum required perl.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 text

This is a L<text composition object|Slack::BlockKit::CompObj::Text> with the
text to be displayed in this block.

If you provide C<text>, then providing C<fields> is an error and will cause an
exception to be raised.

=head2 fields

This is a an arrayref of L<text composition
object|Slack::BlockKit::CompObj::Text> with the text to be displayed in this
block.  These objects will be displayed in two columns, generally.

If you provide C<fields>, then providing C<text> is an error and will cause an
exception to be raised.
