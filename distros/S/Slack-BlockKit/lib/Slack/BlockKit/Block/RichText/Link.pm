=head1 NAME

Slack::BlockKit::Block::RichText::Link - a Block Kit rich text hyperlink element

=head1 VERSION

version 0.005

=head1 OVERVIEW

This represents a hyperlink element in rich text in Block Kit.

=head1 PERL VERSION

This module should work on any version of perl still receiving updates from
the Perl 5 Porters.  This means it should work on any version of perl
released in the last two to three years.  (That is, if the most recently
released version is v5.40, then this module should work on both v5.40 and
v5.38.)

Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made that the
minimum required version will not be increased.  The version may be increased
for any reason, and there is no promise that patches will be accepted to
lower the minimum required perl.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 url

This is the URL to which the link links.

=head2 text

This is the text displayed for the link.  It's optional, and Slack will display
the URL if no text was given.

This attribute stores a string, not any form of Block Kit text object.

=head2 unsafe

This is a boolean indicating whether the link is unsafe.  The author has not
figured out what this actually I<does> and so never uses it.
