Slack::BlockKit::Block::RichText::Channel - a Block Kit rich text element that mentions a #channel

=head1 VERSION

version 0.005

=head1 OVERVIEW

This represents the mention of a specific Slack channel in a hunk of rich text.
The channel name will be styled and linked-to.  So, to send something like:

    We are discussing this on <#kerfuffles>.

You would use the L<sugar|Slack::BlockKit::Sugar> like so:

    blocks(richtext(section(
      "We are discussing this on ", channel($channel_id), "."
    )));

=head1 PERL VERSION

This module should work on any version of perl still receiving updates from
the Perl 5 Porters.  This means it should work on any version of perl
released in the last two to three years.  (That is, if the most recently
released version is v5.40, then this module should work on both v5.40 and
v5.38.)

Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made that the
minimum required version will not be increased.  The version may be increased
for any reason, and there is no promise that patches will be accepted to
lower the minimum required perl.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 channel_id

This must be the Slack channel id for the channel being mentioned.  This is
generally a bunch of alphanumeric characters beginning with C<C>.
