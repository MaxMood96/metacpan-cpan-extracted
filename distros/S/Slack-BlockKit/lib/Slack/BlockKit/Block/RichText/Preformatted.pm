# strike, code) styles, they *can't* have (strike) or (code) when inside a
# preformatted block.

# Testing shows this is not true, so I have not special-cased anything.  (I
# actually wrote the code, but then experiments showed it was not enforced.  I
# filed a bug.)

=head1 NAME

Slack::BlockKit::Block::RichText::Preformatted - a Block Kit preformatted rich text element

=head1 VERSION

version 0.005

=head1 OVERVIEW

This is a "preformatted" element, which basically just means a code block of
the sort you'd get with C<``` ... ```> in Markdown.

=head1 PERL VERSION

This module should work on any version of perl still receiving updates from
the Perl 5 Porters.  This means it should work on any version of perl
released in the last two to three years.  (That is, if the most recently
released version is v5.40, then this module should work on both v5.40 and
v5.38.)

Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made that the
minimum required version will not be increased.  The version may be increased
for any reason, and there is no promise that patches will be accepted to
lower the minimum required perl.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 border

This property is meant to be the number of pixels wide the border is.  In
practice, the author has only found this to cause Slack to reject Block Kit
structures.

=head2 elements

This is an arrayref of rich text elements.  For more information, see the slack
Block Kit documentation.
