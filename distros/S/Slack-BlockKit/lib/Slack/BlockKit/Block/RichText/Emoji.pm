=head1 NAME

Slack::BlockKit::Block::RichText::Emoji - a Block Kit rich text element for a :colon_code: emoji

=head1 VERSION

version 0.005

=head1 OVERVIEW

This represents an C<emoji> element in Block Kit, which are generally put in
place of or between L<text|Slack::BlockKit::Block::RichText::Text> elements in
rich text sections.

=head1 PERL VERSION

This module should work on any version of perl still receiving updates from
the Perl 5 Porters.  This means it should work on any version of perl
released in the last two to three years.  (That is, if the most recently
released version is v5.40, then this module should work on both v5.40 and
v5.38.)

Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made that the
minimum required version will not be increased.  The version may be increased
for any reason, and there is no promise that patches will be accepted to
lower the minimum required perl.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 name

This is the only notable attribute of an Emoji element.  It's the name of the
emoji, as you'd type it in Slack, except without the outer colons.  So C<adult>
rather than C<:adult:> and C<adult::skin-tone-4> rather than
C<:adult::skin-tone-4:>.

At time of writing, unknown emoji names are not an error, but will be displayed
as text inside colons.
