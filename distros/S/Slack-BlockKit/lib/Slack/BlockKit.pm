=head1 NAME

Slack::BlockKit - a toolkit for building Block Kit blocks for Slack

=head1 VERSION

version 0.005

=head1 OVERVIEW

This library is only useful if you're using L<Slack|https://slack.com/>.

Almost any time you want to send content to Slack and you want to end up in
front of a human, you will want to use Block Kit.  You can get away without
using Block Kit if you're only sending plain text or "mrkdwn" text, but even
then, the lack of an escaping mechanism in mrkdwn can be a problem.

The Block Kit system lets you build quite a few different pieces of
presentation, but it's fiddly and the error reporting is I<terrible> if you get
something wrong.  This library is meant to make it I<easy> to write Block Kit
content, and to provide client-side validation of constructed blocks with
better (well, less awful) errors when you make a mistake.

B<You probably want to start here>:  L<Slack::BlockKit::Sugar>.  This library
exports a bunch of functions that can be combined to produce valid Block Kit
structures.  Each of those functions will produce an object, or maybe several.
You shouldn't really need to build any of those objects by hand, but you can.
To find more about the classes shipped with Slack::Block Kit, look at the docs
for the Sugar library and follow the links from there.

=head1 PERL VERSION

This module should work on any version of perl still receiving updates from
the Perl 5 Porters.  This means it should work on any version of perl
released in the last two to three years.  (That is, if the most recently
released version is v5.40, then this module should work on both v5.40 and
v5.38.)

Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made that the
minimum required version will not be increased.  The version may be increased
for any reason, and there is no promise that patches will be accepted to
lower the minimum required perl.

=head1 SECRET ORIGINS

This library was written to improve RJBS's Synergy chat bot.  You can read more
about this process (and the bot) on L<his
