NAME
    Sub::HandlesVia::XS - XS parts for Sub::HandlesVia; no user-serviceable
    parts inside

DESCRIPTION
    Use Sub::HandlesVia. That module will make use of Sub::HandlesVia::XS when
    it can.

INSTALLATION
    If the environment variable `PERL_XS_STRICTC89` is set to true when
    running Makefile.PL, strict C89 flags will be passed to the C compiled
    when compiling Sub::HandlesVia::XS. This will also happen if Makefile.PL
    detects it is likely being run in the author's development environment.

    In general, the module should work the same in either case.
