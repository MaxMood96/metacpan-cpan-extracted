v0.03  2025-10-27Z
    - Improved documentation
    - Added support for more from types: DateTime, SIRTX::Datecode, Data::Identifier
    - Allow SIRTX::Datecode to be used in as()
    - Added is_utc(), is_floating(), and is_null()
    - Added precision()
    - Updated generator protections
    - Added null() to create null datecodes
    - Added now() to create datecodes for the current time
    - No longer inherit from Data::Identifier::Interface::Userdata as that was broken.
      No harm is done to existing applications as this did not work anyway.
      Later versions will likely add this feature again.
