SYNOPSIS

        my $owid = WebService::OurWorldInData->new({
            proxy => '...', # your web proxy
        });
    
        my $search = $owid->search( q => 'star', fl => 'bibcode' );

DESCRIPTION

    This is a base class for Our World in Data APIs. You probably should be
    using the WebService::OurWorldInData::Chart class.

 Getting Started

    Documentation for Chart API
    <https://docs.owid.io/projects/etl/api/chart-api/>

 Proxies

    The UA gets the proxy from your environment variable _or_ create a
    HTTP::Tiny object with the {all_proxy => "proxy url"} attribute and
    pass that to the ua attribute of the API constructor

        $tiny_ua = HTTP::Tiny->new({all_proxy => "http://proxy.url"});
        $client = WebService::OurWorldInData->new({ ua => $tiny_ua });

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

    I am stealing from Neil Bowers' WebService::HackerNews to learn how he
    does APIs with HTTP::Tiny. This is a re-write from my first version in
    Mojo. Any mistakes, of course, are mine.
