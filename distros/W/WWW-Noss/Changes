Revision history for noss (WWW::Noss)

1.09  Sep 16 2025
  - Add support for MRSS (MediaRSS) feeds, like those used by YouTube.
  - Added ability to specify a negative post ID in open, read, cat, and post
    commands. This allows you to look for a post relative to the end of the
    feed (-1 corresponds to the last post, -2 to the 2nd to last, etc).
  - 'list --sort ...' now does alphabetical sorting case-insensitively.
  - Add --hard option to update and reload commands: Hard reload a feed by
    deleting it prior to reloading it into noss's database.
  - For posts that have no title but have a description, noss generates a title
    from the post's description. If a post has no description, its link is used
    instead.
  - Properly read HTML titles in Atom feeds.
  - Post and feed titles now have whitespace trimmed and truncated.
  - Fix bug where updating an existing post would replace its contents with
    its category JSON.
