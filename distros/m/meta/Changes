        [BUGFIXES]
         * Skip t/80subname+Sub-Util.t on perls that don't have Sub::Util

0.012   2024-10-14
        [BUGFIXES]
         * Make `$metasub->signature` work correctly on `method` subs of
           Perl 5.38

0.011   2024-10-08
        [BUGFIXES]
         * Various small fixes to avoid upsetting `gcc -Wall`

0.010   2024-10-01
        [CHANGES]
         * Added `$metasub->signature` and the meta-signature object
           representation

        [BUGFIXES]
         * Don't leak extra `SVt_NULL` SVs from the internal `wrap_*()` helper
           functions

0.009   2024-09-14
        [CHANGES]
         * Added `$metapkg->is_class` and `$metasub->is_method` for querying
           about elements created with Perl 5.38's `use feature 'class'`

        [BUGFIXES]
         * Use `GvCVu()` when looking at the CV slot of a GV so as not to get
           confused about method caches

0.008   2024-09-11
        [CHANGES]
         * Added `$metapkg->add_named_sub` for efficiently adding subroutines
           and setting the subname of them at the same time
         * Complain if the `->get` method is called on a metapackage instance,
           and remind users they probably wanted a `->get_*` method instead

        [CHANGES]
         * Added `meta::for_reference()`
         * Added `$metasub->set_subname` and `->set_prototype`, which can be
           used to replace `Sub::Util`.
         * Account for refcount retention of referred items when creating meta
           wrappers, now that the `for_reference()` constructor can wrap
           anonymous things too

0.006   2024-09-06
        [CHANGES]
         * Added `$metapkg->list_symbols` and `$metapkg->list_subpackages`

        [CHANGES]
         * Added `meta::package->list_globs` and variations

0.004   2024-01-06
        [CHANGES]
         * Emit warnings in the `meta::experimental` category from all
           entrypoint functions.
         * Added `meta::package->get` and `meta::glob->get` constructors
         * Added `->try_get_...` name variant of all the `can` methods
         * Added `meta::glob->try_get`
         * Added `meta::glob->get_or_add` and `$metapkg->get_or_add_symbol`

        [BUGFIXES]
         * Avoid C99-style variable declaration in for loop
         * Make sure to define _MUST_SVTYPE_FROM_REFSV also for compilers that
           lack PERL_USE_GCC_BRACE_GROUPS

0.003   2023-12-31
        [CHANGES]
         * Add documentation pointing out it's experimental
         * Add a SEE ALSO link to the PPC 0022 document
