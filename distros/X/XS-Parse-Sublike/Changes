        [BUGFIXES]
         * Ensure test .xs files are valid C before C23, by not using unnamed

        [CHANGES]
         * Allow `Sublike::Extended` to take over core perl's handling of

        [CHANGES]
         * Use `File::ShareDir` for storing .h include file, rather than
           storing the contents in the `__DATA__` section of the build helper

0.21    2023-10-11
