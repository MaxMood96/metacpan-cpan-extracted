NAME
    RT::Extension::Captcha - use Google reCAPTCHA v3 to verify users before
    some actions in RT

DESCRIPTION
    This extension uses Google reCAPTCHA v3 for user verification when a
    user creates a ticket (using either regular interface or quick create)
    and on replies/comments (updates).

    Previous 1.* versions of this extension generated a captcha image for
    the user to solve. With the switch to Google reCAPTCHA v3 the user will
    no longer be interrupted by a captcha image.

RT VERSION
    Works with RT 6.0.0 and newer. Install the latest 1.* version for older
    RTs.

INSTALLATION
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install
        May need root permissions

    Edit your /opt/rt5/etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm
        Add this line:

            Plugin('RT::Extension::Captcha');

    Clear your mason cache
            rm -rf /opt/rt5/var/mason_data/obj

    Restart your webserver

CONFIGURATION
  No CAPTCHA rights
    Users who have right 'NoCaptchaOnCreate' or 'NoCaptchaOnUpdate' will not
    have any user verification done on corresponding actions.

  Create Google reCAPTCHA key
    To create a reCAPTCHA key see here
    <https://cloud.google.com/recaptcha/docs/create-key-website>

  $CaptchaSiteKey
    Set your Google reCAPTCHA site key. This is required.

        Set( $CaptchaSiteKey, '...' );

  $CaptchaSecret
    Set your Google reCAPTCHA secret key. This is required.

        Set( $CaptchaSecret, '...' );

  $CaptchaScore
    Set the minimum score to verify a user. This is optional and must be a
    value between 0 and 1. It defaults to 0.5.

    The higher the score the more likely the user is real. Setting a higher
    value for CaptchaScore means it is harder for robots to fool the
    verification but also makes it more possible a real user might fail
    verification.

        Set( $CaptchaScore, 0.4 );
