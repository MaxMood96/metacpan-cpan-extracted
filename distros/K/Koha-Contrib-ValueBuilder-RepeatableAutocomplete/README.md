# SYNOPSIS

    Koha::Contrib::ValueBuilder::RepeatableAutocomplete->build_builder_inline(
            {   target => '4',
                data   => [
                  { label => 'ArchitektIn', value => 'arc' },
                  # and more...

# DESCRIPTION

`Koha::Contrib::ValueBuilder::RepeatableAutocomplete` helps building
`Koha Valuebuilder Plugins`. [Koha](https://koha-community.org/) is
the world's first free and open source library system.

This module implements some functions that will generate the
JavaScript / jQuery needed by the Koha Edit Form to enable a simple
autocomplete lookup, while also working with repeatable MARC21 fields.

Please take a look at the helper modules included in this
distribution, which pack all the lookup values and their configuration
into easy to use functions:

- [Koha::Contrib::ValueBuilder::RepeatableAutocomplete::RDA](https://metacpan.org/pod/Koha%3A%3AContrib%3A%3AValueBuilder%3A%3ARepeatableAutocomplete%3A%3ARDA)

    Values for Field `100` and `700` subfields `$e` and `$e`, creator
    and other agents.

## Functions

### build\_builder\_inline

Build JS to handle a short inline autocomplete lookup (data is
provided to the function, not loaded via AJAX etc). The field will be
inferred from the form element the value\_builder is bound to.

    build_builder_inline(
          {   target    => '4',
              data      => [ { label=>"Foo", value=>'foo' }, ... ],
              minlength => 3.
          }
      );

Parameters:

- `target`: required

    The subfield of the MARC field into which the selected `value` is stored.

- `data`: required

    An ARRAY of HASHes, each hash has to contain a key `label` (which
    will be what the users enter) and a key `value` which has to contain
    the value to be stored in `target`

- `minlength`; optional, defaults to 3

    Input length that will trigger the autocomplete.

### build\_builder\_inline\_multiple

Build JS to handle a short inline autocomplete lookup (data is
provided to the function, not loaded via AJAX etc). The selected value
will be inserted into multiple subfields. The field will be inferred
from the form element the value\_builder is bound to.

    build_builder_inline(
          {   target_map => [
                  { subfield=>'b', type=>'selected', key=>'value' },
                  { subfield=>'a', type=>'selected', key=>'other' },
                  { subfield=>'2', type=>'literal',  literal=>'rdacontent' }
              ],
              data      => [ { label=>"Foo", value=>'foo', other=>'FOO', }, ... ],
              minlength => 3.
          }
      );

Parameters:

- `target_map`: required

    A list of subfields and how to fill them with data based on the selected value.

    - subfield: the subfield to fill
    - type: how to fill the subfield. Currently we have two types:
    `selected` and `literal`
    - selected: If type is `selected`, fill the subfield with the
    value of the selected data mapped to the key specified here

        \-item \* literal: If type is `literal`, fill the subfield with this literal value

- `data`: required

    An ARRAY of HASHes, each hash has to contain a key `label` (which
    will be what the users enter) and some more keys which can be mapped
    to subfields using `target_map` entries of type `selected`.

    Given this `target_map`

        [
           { subfield=>'b', type=>'selected', key=>'value' },
           { subfield=>'a', type=>'selected', key=>'other' },
           { subfield=>'2', type=>'literal',  literal=>'rdacontent' }
        ],

    And this `data`

        { label=>"Foo", value=>'foo', other=>'FOO' }

    Selecting "Foo" will store `value` ("foo">) into subfield `b`,
    `other` ("FOO">) into subfield `a` and the literal value
    "rdacontent" into `2`.

- `minlength`; optional, defaults to 3

    Input length that will trigger the autocomplete.

## Usage in Koha

You will need to write a `value_builder` Perl script and put it into
`/usr/share/koha/intranet/cgi-bin/cataloguing/value_builder`. You can
find some example value-builder scripts in `example/`. The should
look something like this:

    #!/usr/bin/perl
    use strict;
    use warnings;
    
    use Koha::Contrib::ValueBuilder::RepeatableAutocomplete::RDA qw(creator);
    
    return creator('de');

You than will have to enable this value\_builder as a Plugin in the
respective MARC21 Framework / field / subfield.
