VERSION

    version 0.10

SYNOPSIS

    From Perl:

     use Alien::cmake3;
     use Env qw( @PATH );
     
     unshift @PATH, Alien::cmake3->bin_dir;
     system 'cmake', ...;

    From alienfile

     use alienfile;
     
     share {
       # Build::CMake plugin pulls in Alien::cmake3 automatically
       plugin 'Build::CMake';
       build [
         # this is the default build step, if you do not specify one.
         [ '%{cmake3}', -G => '%{cmake_generator}', '-DCMAKE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE:BOOL=true', '-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=%{.install.prefix}', '.' ],
         '%{make}',
         '%{make} install',
       ];
     };

DESCRIPTION

    This Alien distribution provides an external dependency on the build
    tool cmake version 3.x.x. cmake is a popular alternative to autoconf.

METHODS

 bin_dir

     my @dirs = Alien::cmake3->bin_dir;

    List of directories that need to be added to the PATH in order for
    cmake to work.

 exe

     my $exe = Alien::cmake3->exe;

    The name of the cmake executable.

HELPERS

 cmake3

     %{cmake3}

    The name of the cmake executable.

SEE ALSO

    Alien::Build::Plugin::Build::CMake

      Alien::Build plugin for cmake This will automatically pull in
      Alien::cmake3 if you need it.

    Alien::CMake

      This is an older distribution that provides an alienized cmake. It is
      different in these ways:

      Alien::cmake3 is based on alienfile and Alien::Build

	It integrates better with Aliens that are based on that technology.

      Alien::cmake3 will provide version 3.x.x

	Alien::CMake will provide 2.x.x on some platforms where more recent
	binaries are not available.

      Alien::cmake3 will install on platforms where there is no system
      cmake and no binary cmake provided by cmake.org

	It does this by building cmake from source.

      Alien::cmake3 is preferred

	In the opinion of the maintainer of both Alien::cmake3 and
	Alien::CMake for these reasons.

ENVIRONMENT

    ALIEN_INSTALL_TYPE

      This is the normal Alien::Build environment variable and you can set
      it to one of share, system or default.

    ALIEN_CMAKE_FROM_SOURCE

      If set to true, and if a share install is attempted, Alien::cmake3
      will not try a binary share install (even if available), and instead
      a source share install.

CAVEATS

    If you do not have a system cmake version 3.x.x available, then a share
    install will be attempted.

    Binary share installs are attempted on platforms for which the latest
    version of cmake are provided. As of this writing, this includes:
    Windows (32/64 bit), macOS (intel/arm universal) and Linux (intel/arm
    64 bit). No checks are made to ensure that your platform is supported
    by this binary installs. Typically the same versions supported by the
    operating system vendor and supported by cmake, so that should not be a
    problem. If you are using an operating system not supported by its
    vendor Please Stop That, this is almost certainly a security
    vulnerability.

    That said if you really do need Alien::cmake3 on an unsupported system,
    you have some options:

    Install system version of cmake

      If you can find an older version of cmake 3.x.x that is supported by
      your operating system.

    Force a source code install

      Set the ALIEN_CMAKE_FROM_SOURCE environment variable to a true value
      to build a share install from source.

    Source share installs are attempted on platforms for which the latest
    version of cmake are not available, like the various flavours of *BSD.
    This may not be ideal, and if you can install a system version of cmake
    it may work better.
