=head1 NAME

lru - LRU cache with O(1) operations

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use lru;
    
    # Create cache with max 1000 entries
    my $cache = lru::new(1000);
    
    # Store values - O(1)
    $cache->set('key1', $value);
    $cache->set('user:123', { name => 'Bob', age => 30 });
    
    # Retrieve values - O(1), promotes to front
    my $val = $cache->get('key1');
    
    # Check existence without promoting - O(1)
    if ($cache->exists('key1')) { ... }
    
    # Peek without promoting - O(1)
    my $val = $cache->peek('key1');
    
    # Delete entry - O(1)
    $cache->delete('key1');
    
    # Cache info
    my $size = $cache->size;      # Current entries
    my $cap = $cache->capacity;   # Max entries
    
    # Clear all entries
    $cache->clear;
    
    # Get all keys (most recent first)
    my @keys = $cache->keys;

=head2 The function-style API you should use

    use lru qw(import);
    
    my $cache = lru::new(1000);
    
    # Function-style ops eliminate method dispatch overhead
    # ~2x faster than method calls
    lru_set($cache, 'key', $value);    # 40M+ ops/sec
    my $v = lru_get($cache, 'key');    # 62M+ ops/sec
    lru_exists($cache, 'key');         # 60M+ ops/sec
    lru_peek($cache, 'key');           # 60M+ ops/sec
    lru_delete($cache, 'key');         # 60M+ ops/sec

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<lru> provides a fast Least Recently Used cache implemented in C.
All operations are O(1) using a hash table for lookups and a doubly
linked list for ordering.

When the cache reaches capacity, the least recently used entry is
automatically evicted on the next C<set>.

=head2 Performance

=over 4

=item * B<get/set>: O(1) - hash lookup + list splice

=item * B<exists/peek>: O(1) - hash lookup only

=item * B<delete>: O(1) - hash delete + list remove

=head1 METHODS

=head2 lru::new($capacity)

Create a new LRU cache with the given maximum capacity.

=head2 $cache->set($key, $value)

Store a value. If key exists, updates value and promotes to front.
If at capacity, evicts least recently used entry first.

=head2 $cache->get($key)

Retrieve a value and promote to front. Returns undef if not found.

=head2 $cache->peek($key)

Retrieve a value without promoting. Returns undef if not found.

=head2 $cache->exists($key)

Check if key exists. Does not promote.

=head2 $cache->delete($key)

Remove an entry. Returns the deleted value or undef.

=head2 $cache->size

Returns the current number of entries.

=head2 $cache->capacity

Returns the maximum capacity.

=head2 $cache->clear

Remove all entries.

=head2 $cache->keys

Returns all keys in order (most recent first).

=head2 $cache->oldest

    my ($key, $value) = $cache->oldest;

Returns the key and value of the least recently used entry (the one
that would be evicted next if the cache is full). Returns an empty
list if the cache is empty.

=head2 $cache->newest

    my ($key, $value) = $cache->newest;

Returns the key and value of the most recently used entry.
Returns an empty list if the cache is empty.

=head1 FUNCTION-STYLE API

For maximum performance, import function-style ops:

    use lru qw(import);

This exports the following functions into your namespace:

=head2 lru_set($cache, $key, $value)

Set a key/value pair. Returns the value.
Approximately 70% faster than C<< $cache->set(...) >>.

=head2 lru_get($cache, $key)

Get a value, promoting to front. Returns undef if not found.
Approximately 2x faster than C<< $cache->get(...) >>.

=head2 lru_exists($cache, $key)

Check if key exists. Does not promote.
Approximately 2x faster than C<< $cache->exists(...) >>.

=head2 lru_peek($cache, $key)

Get a value without promoting. Returns undef if not found.
Approximately 2x faster than C<< $cache->peek(...) >>.

=head2 lru_delete($cache, $key)

Delete a key. Returns the deleted value or undef.
Approximately 2x faster than C<< $cache->delete(...) >>.

=head2 lru_oldest($cache)

    my ($key, $value) = lru_oldest($cache);

Returns the key and value of the least recently used entry.
Returns an empty list if the cache is empty.

=head2 lru_newest($cache)

    my ($key, $value) = lru_newest($cache);

Returns the key and value of the most recently used entry.
Returns an empty list if the cache is empty.
