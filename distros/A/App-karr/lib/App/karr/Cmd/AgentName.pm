=head1 NAME

App::karr::Cmd::AgentName - Generate a random two-word agent name

=head1 VERSION

version 0.600

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    karr agentname

    # Capture the name once, then pass the same variable to every call that
    # has to agree about the claim:
    NAME=$(karr agentname)
    karr pick --claim "$NAME" --move in-progress
    karr handoff 7 --claim "$NAME" --note "Implementation complete"

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Generates a random two-word, lowercase agent name joined by a hyphen. The
command prefers the system dictionary when available and falls back to the
built-in word list otherwise.

Every call mints a new name. Nothing is remembered between calls -- not per
board, not per process, not per agent -- so C<$(karr agentname)> written twice
produces two unrelated names.

That matters because claims are compared by name. C<--claim> on
L<App::karr::Cmd::Pick> and L<App::karr::Cmd::Move> records the name;
L<App::karr::Cmd::Move>, L<App::karr::Cmd::Edit> and
L<App::karr::Cmd::Handoff> check the name they are handed against the one on
the card (L<App::karr::Role::ClaimTimeout/check_claim>); and C<karr list
--claimed-by> and C<karr log --agent> select on it. So this pair

    karr pick --claim "$(karr agentname)" --move in-progress    # DON'T
    karr handoff 7 --claim "$(karr agentname)"                  # DON'T

claims under one name and hands off under another. Substituting the command
inline is only ever correct where the name is used once and never referred to
again -- which is almost never, since the handoff at the end of the work is a
second reference. Capture it into a shell variable instead, as the SYNOPSIS
does (ticket #176).

A name that was not captured is still recoverable from the board rather than
lost: C<karr pick> prints C<(claimed by NAME)>, C<karr show ID> prints
C<Claimed:>, and the refusal C<check_claim> raises names the current claimant.
Minting a fresh one instead is the mistake. While the original claim is live
the mismatch is refused outright; once it has expired the mutation goes
through and re-stamps the card, but no longer without saying so -- the
override is reported with the name it stepped over
(L<App::karr::Role::ClaimTimeout/expired_claim_report>), which is the same
name to go back to.

The generated name is deliberately not made stable per agent. Any handle that
would survive across separate C<karr> processes -- the board, the Git
identity, the host -- is equally shared by every other agent working that same
board, so deriving a name from one would hand two concurrent agents an
identical claim. That is strictly worse than the mismatch it would fix: a
mismatch is refused by C<check_claim>, a collision is indistinguishable from
the rightful owner and is not. Callers that need a stable identity should
supply their own name and not go through this command, which exists to suggest
a name, not to remember one.
