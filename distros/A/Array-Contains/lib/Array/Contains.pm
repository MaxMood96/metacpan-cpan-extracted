=head1 NAME

Array::Contains - Check if an array contains a specific element

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Array::Contains;

  if(contains($somevalue, \@myarray)) {
    # Do something
  }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Array::Contains is a simple replacement for the most commonly used
application of the (deprecated) Smartmatch operator: checking if an
array contains a specific element.

This module is designed for convenience and readable code rather than for
speed.

If you are running a Perl version prior to 5.42.0, this is implemented using a classic for loop.

From 5.42.0 onwards, this uses the new "any" keyword for higher performance. The API is Array::Contains shouldn't look any different to the caller, though. Just, maybe, a tiny bit faster.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

This module currently exports its only function by default:

=head2 contains()

C<contains()> takes one scalar and one array reference and returns true (1) if
the scalar is contained in the array. C<contains()> does NOT do recursive lookups,
but only looks into the root array.
