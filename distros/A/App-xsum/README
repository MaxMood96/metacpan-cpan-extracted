NAME
    App::xsum - Compute and check file checksums/digests (using various
    algorithms)

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.011 of App::xsum (from Perl
    distribution App-xsum), released on 2025-08-25.

SYNOPSIS
    See xsum.

FUNCTIONS
  xsum
    Usage:

     xsum(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    Compute and check file checksums/digests (using various algorithms).

    "xsum" is a handy small utility that can be used as an
    alternative/replacement for the individual per-algorithm Unix utilities
    like "md5sum", "sha1sum", "sha224sum", and so on. It's basically the
    same as said Unix utilities but you can use a single command instead.

    The backend of "xsum" is a Perl module File::Digest which in turn
    delegates to the individual per-algorithm backend like Digest::MD5,
    Digest::SHA, and so on. Most of the backend modules are written in C/XS
    so you don't suffer significant performance decrease.

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   algorithm => *str*

        In addition to "md5", "sha1" or the other algorithms, you can also
        specify "Digest" to use Perl's Digest module. This gives you access
        to tens of other digest modules, for example Digest::BLAKE2 (see
        examples).

        When "--digest-args" ("-A") is not specified, algorithm defaults to
        "md5". But if "--digest-args" ("-A") is specified, algorithm
        defaults to "Digest", for convenience.

    *   check => *bool*

        Read checksum from files and check them.

    *   checksums => *array[str]*

        Supply checksum(s).

    *   digest_args => *array*

        If you use "Digest" as the algorithm, you can pass arguments for the
        Digest module here.

    *   files => *array[filename]*

        (No description)

    *   files_from => *filename*

        (No description)

    *   tag => *bool*

        Create a BSD-style checksum.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status
    code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second
    element ($reason) is a string containing error message, or something
    like "OK" if status is 200. Third element ($payload) is the actual
    result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error
    response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth element (%result_meta) is
    called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional
    metadata.

    Return value: (any)

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
