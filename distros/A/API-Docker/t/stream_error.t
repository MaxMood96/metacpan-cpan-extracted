    # build -- a failing RUN step leaves it behind, under an engine-chosen
    # name (Docker: priceless_driscoll, ...) or, on Podman, as a buildah
    # "working container" that GET /containers/json never lists at all
    # (measured against 5.8.4). karr k63: a day of live runs stranded 14 such
    # containers, on both engines, invisible to register_cleanup because none
    # of them are named by the test -- the daemon creates them, not us.

    # forcerm=1 is the engine's own answer to exactly this case ("always

    # does put the id in a "Running in <id>" stream line, but Podman's
    # buildah backend never mentions an id anywhere in the stream or the
    # response headers, so scraping the stream cannot be the general fix.
