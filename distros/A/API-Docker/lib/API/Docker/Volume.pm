# A removed class, kept as a stub on purpose (karr k92). A module that
# disappears from a distribution does not disappear from the disks it was
# installed on: the old file stays behind and keeps loading, so deleting it
# here would leave a working API::Docker::Volume shadowing this release for
# everyone who ever installed the last one. Shipping a file overwrites it;
# shipping nothing does not.
#
# It refuses instead of working, and it refuses at load rather than at the
# first method call, because that is the earliest point at which the caller
# can be told -- and because @Author::GETTY generates no compile-all author
# test that a dying module would fail. Measured on 2026-08-28: the bundle
# generates exactly xt/author/pod-syntax.t, which parses POD without loading
# anything, and xt/release/changes_has_content.t, which only reads Changes.

=head1 NAME

API::Docker::Volume - Removed in 0.004 -- replaced by API::Docker::Type::Volume

=head1 VERSION

version 0.004

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<This class is gone.> It has been replaced by the generated type model, and
this file is a stub: loading it croaks, and so does every method call on it.

This class was released in 0.003 and removed in 0.004. Installing 0.004
over it replaces the working copy with this stub, which is the only reason
the file is still in the distribution.

What to reach for instead:

=over

=item * L<API::Docker::Type::Volume> -- what C<< volumes->list >>, C<< volumes->inspect >> and C<< volumes->create >> return

=item * L<API::Docker::Role::Entity::Volume> -- inspect and remove,
unchanged, composed into the above at load time

=back

Where this class mirrored the daemon's CamelCase verbatim, the generated
classes carry the swagger's own names in snake_case.
L<API::Docker::API::Volumes> documents the shape each method returns.

=head1 SEE ALSO

=over

=item * L<API::Docker::API::Volumes> - the resource class these objects come from

=item * L<API::Docker::Role::Entity> - why the methods live in a role
