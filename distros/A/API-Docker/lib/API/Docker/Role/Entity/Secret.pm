# would silently keep its place and the method would be missing -- and the
# generated classes are written from a specification that grows fields
# without asking. None of the four names collides today; a future one says so
# on the first `use`. `version_index` is the one to watch: the class already
# declares `version`.

=head1 NAME

API::Docker::Role::Entity::Secret - Secret operations, on the generated secret type

=head1 VERSION

version 0.004

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $docker = API::Docker->new;
    my ($secret) = @{ $docker->secrets->list };

    say $secret->id;
    say $secret->spec->name;
    say $secret->version_index;

    my %spec = %{ $secret->spec->TO_JSON };
    $spec{Labels} = { env => 'staging' };
    $secret->update(%spec);

    $secret->remove;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The convenience methods of a Docker secret. This role is composed, at load
time, into L<API::Docker::Type::Secret>, the generated class the daemon
answers secret requests with -- the same definition for C<GET /secrets> and
C<GET /secrets/{id}>, so L<API::Docker::API::Secrets/list> and
L<API::Docker::API::Secrets/inspect> hand back one class and there is no
list-versus-inspect shape to keep apart.

=head2 There is no accessor for the value

A secret carries no payload on this API at all. The daemon hands the value to
containers, never back over C</secrets>: neither C<list> nor C<inspect>
returns a C<< spec->data >>, so there is nothing here to decode. That is why
this role has no C<decoded_data>, where
L<API::Docker::Role::Entity::Config> does -- the difference is in what the
engine sends, not in what the two choose to offer. In the C<GET /secrets>
response captured from Podman 5.4.2 (API 1.41) in
F<t/fixtures/secrets_list.json>, each object carries C<ID>, C<CreatedAt>,
C<UpdatedAt>, C<Spec> and C<Version>, and the C<Spec> has C<Name>, C<Driver>
and C<Labels> but no C<Data> key whatsoever. The swagger agrees: it documents
C<SecretSpec.Data> as used to I<create> a secret and not returned by other
endpoints.

C<< $secret->spec->data >> therefore exists as an accessor -- the field is in
the definition -- and reads C<undef> on anything an engine sent back.

If you need to read a value back, a secret is the wrong storage -- put it in
a config, see L<API::Docker::API::Configs>.

=head2 The spec goes back as a whole

C<< $secret->spec >> is an L<API::Docker::Type::SecretSpec> object rather
than the raw HashRef the hand-written entity kept, so the idiom for an update
is C<< %{ $secret->spec->TO_JSON } >>: C<TO_JSON> renders the spec back into
the daemon's own spelling, which is what L</update> puts in the request body.

Why the whole spec and not the one key you changed:
L<API::Docker::API::Secrets/"update takes the current version, and it is
mandatory">.

Why the methods are a role applied to a generated class rather than a class
of their own: L<API::Docker::Role::Entity/DESCRIPTION>.

=head2 version_index

    my $index = $secret->version_index;

The C<< ->index >> out of C<< ->version >>, which is what the daemon wants as
the C<version> query parameter on an update. Returns nothing when the object
carries no C<Version> -- including the case where the daemon sent one the
model could not use, which leaves the attribute unset and the raw value in
C<< ->unknown_fields->{Version} >>.

It is the version as of the moment this object was fetched, which is exactly
the token's meaning: an update built on a stale entity is refused by the
daemon rather than silently overwriting whatever changed in between.

=head2 inspect

    my $fresh = $secret->inspect;

Get fresh secret information. Returns another L<API::Docker::Type::Secret> --
the same class, since the daemon describes a secret one way.

=head2 update

    my %spec = %{ $secret->spec->TO_JSON };
    $spec{Labels} = { env => 'staging' };
    $secret->update(%spec);

Update the secret. Passes C<< ->id >> and, by default, L</version_index> to
L<API::Docker::API::Secrets/update>; everything else is the spec and becomes
the request body.

The default is only a default. A C<version> key in the arguments is used
verbatim and removed before the spec goes out -- the spec's own fields are all
capitalised (C<Name>, C<Labels>, C<Data>, ...), so a lowercase C<version>
cannot collide with one:

    $secret->update(version => $index, %spec);

Send the whole spec back with the one key edited; the Engine API accepts a
change to C<Labels> only and wants every other field unchanged. Podman does
not implement this endpoint and answers 501.

=head2 remove

    $secret->remove;

Remove the secret. The daemon answers 204 with no body, so this returns
nothing.
