=head1 NAME

API::Docker::Type::ContainerPidsStats - PidsStats contains Linux-specific stats of a container's process-IDs (PIDs)

=head1 VERSION

version 0.004

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Generated from the C<ContainerPidsStats> definition of C<spec/v1.51.yaml>.

This type is Linux-specific and omitted for Windows containers.

=head2 current

Current is the number of PIDs in the cgroup. Serialised as C<current> --
spelled out, because deriving it from the Perl name would produce
C<Current>.

=head2 limit

Limit is the hard limit on the number of pids in the cgroup. A "Limit" of 0
means that there is no limit. Serialised as C<limit> -- spelled out, because
deriving it from the Perl name would produce C<Limit>.
