=head1 NAME

API::Docker::Type::ImageInspect::RootFS - Information about the image's RootFS, including the layer IDs

=head1 VERSION

version 0.004

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Generated from the inline C<RootFS> schema of the C<ImageInspect> definition
in C<spec/v1.51.yaml>.

=head2 type

Undocumented upstream. How the root filesystem is stored. C<layers> is the
only value the swagger shows, and the only one measured: C<GET
/images/{id}/json> on Podman 5.8.4 (API 1.44) answers C<"Type": "layers">.

=head2 layers

Undocumented upstream. One diff ID per layer of the image. Measured against
Podman 5.8.4 (API 1.44), a Debian-based image answers eight C<sha256:...>
digests here; the swagger's example shows two of the same form.
