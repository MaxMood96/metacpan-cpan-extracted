=head1 NAME

API::Docker::Type::Service::ServiceStatus - The status of the service's tasks

=head1 VERSION

version 0.004

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Generated from the inline C<ServiceStatus> schema of the C<Service>
definition in C<spec/v1.51.yaml>.

Provided only when requested as part of a ServiceList operation.

=head2 running_tasks

The number of tasks for the service currently in the Running state.

=head2 desired_tasks

The number of tasks for the service desired to be running. For replicated
services, this is the replica count from the service spec. For global
services, this is computed by taking count of all tasks for the service with
a Desired State other than Shutdown.

=head2 completed_tasks

The number of tasks for a job that are in the Completed state. This field
must be cross-referenced with the service type, as the value of 0 may mean
the service is not in a job mode, or it may mean the job-mode service has no
tasks yet Completed.
