API::Docker::Type::ContainerThrottlingData - CPU throttling stats of the container

=head1 VERSION

version 0.004

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Generated from the C<ContainerThrottlingData> definition of
C<spec/v1.51.yaml>.

This type is Linux-specific and omitted for Windows containers.

=head2 periods

Number of periods with throttling active. Serialised as C<periods> --
spelled out, because deriving it from the Perl name would produce
C<Periods>.

=head2 throttled_periods

Number of periods when the container hit its throttling limit. Serialised as
C<throttled_periods> -- spelled out, because deriving it from the Perl name
would produce C<ThrottledPeriods>.

=head2 throttled_time

Aggregated time (in nanoseconds) the container was throttled for. Serialised
as C<throttled_time> -- spelled out, because deriving it from the Perl name
would produce C<ThrottledTime>.
