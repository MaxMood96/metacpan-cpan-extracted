API::Docker::Type::SwarmSpec::Raft - Raft configuration

=head1 VERSION

version 0.004

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Generated from the inline C<Raft> schema of the C<SwarmSpec> definition in
C<spec/v1.51.yaml>.

=head2 snapshot_interval

The number of log entries between snapshots.

=head2 keep_old_snapshots

The number of snapshots to keep beyond the current snapshot.

=head2 log_entries_for_slow_followers

The number of log entries to keep around to sync up slow followers after a
snapshot is created.

=head2 election_tick

The number of ticks that a follower will wait for a message from the leader
before becoming a candidate and starting an election. C<ElectionTick> must
be greater than C<HeartbeatTick>.

A tick currently defaults to one second, so these translate directly to
seconds currently, but this is NOT guaranteed.

=head2 heartbeat_tick

The number of ticks between heartbeats. Every HeartbeatTick ticks, the
leader will send a heartbeat to the followers.

A tick currently defaults to one second, so these translate directly to
seconds currently, but this is NOT guaranteed.
