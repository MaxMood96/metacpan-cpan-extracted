=head1 NAME

API::Docker::Type::PluginInterfaceType - One entry of C<Plugin.Config.Interface.Types>

=head1 VERSION

version 0.004

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Generated from the C<PluginInterfaceType> definition of C<spec/v1.51.yaml>,
which the swagger leaves undescribed. Nothing in C<paths:> reaches it
either; it is one entry of C<Plugin.Config.Interface.Types>. The example the
swagger gives for that field is the bare string C<docker.volumedriver/1.0>
rather than an object, and its three parts line up with the three fields
below in the order they appear.

=head2 prefix

Undocumented upstream. C<docker> in that example. The swagger lists this
field as required; nothing here enforces that, see
L<API::Docker::Type/C<since> is documentation>.

=head2 capability

Undocumented upstream. C<volumedriver> in that example. The swagger lists
this field as required; nothing here enforces that, see
L<API::Docker::Type/C<since> is documentation>.

=head2 version

Undocumented upstream. C<1.0> in that example. The swagger lists this field
as required; nothing here enforces that, see L<API::Docker::Type/C<since> is
documentation>.
