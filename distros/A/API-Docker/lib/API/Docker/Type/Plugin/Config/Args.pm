=head1 NAME

API::Docker::Type::Plugin::Config::Args - The command-line arguments a plugin accepts

=head1 VERSION

version 0.004

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Generated from the inline C<Args> schema of C<Plugin.Config> in
C<spec/v1.51.yaml>, which the swagger leaves undescribed.

=head2 name

Undocumented upstream. C<args> in the swagger's example -- the whole command
line is one named item, not one item per argument.

=head2 description

Undocumented upstream. C<"command line arguments"> in the swagger's example.

=head2 settable

Undocumented upstream. An array of strings, and the swagger never says what
they hold. What a user changes on an installed plugin goes in through C<POST
/plugins/{name}/set> and comes back out under
L<API::Docker::Type::Plugin/settings>.

=head2 value

Undocumented upstream. The arguments themselves, one string each.
