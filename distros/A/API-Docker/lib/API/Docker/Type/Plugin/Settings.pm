=head1 VERSION

version 0.004

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Generated from the inline C<Settings> schema of the C<Plugin> definition in
C<spec/v1.51.yaml>.

=head2 mounts

Undocumented upstream. The plugin's mounts as they now stand;
L<API::Docker::Type::Plugin::Config/mounts> is the same list as the plugin
declared it. See L<API::Docker::Type::PluginMount>.

=head2 env

Undocumented upstream. The environment as bare C<NAME=value> strings, C<<
["DEBUG=0"] >> in the swagger's example -- the shape C<POST
/plugins/{name}/set> takes in its body, whose own example is C<< ["DEBUG=1"]
>>. L<API::Docker::Type::Plugin::Config/env> carries the same variables as
objects with their descriptions.

=head2 args

Undocumented upstream. The command line as bare strings, against the single
named item L<API::Docker::Type::Plugin::Config/args> declares.

=head2 devices

Undocumented upstream. The plugin's devices as they now stand;
L<API::Docker::Type::Plugin::Config::Linux/devices> is the declared list.
See L<API::Docker::Type::PluginDevice>.
