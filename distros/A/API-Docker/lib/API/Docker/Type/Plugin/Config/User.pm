=head1 NAME

API::Docker::Type::Plugin::Config::User - The user and group a plugin's process runs as

=head1 VERSION

version 0.004

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Generated from the inline C<User> schema of C<Plugin.Config> in
C<spec/v1.51.yaml>, which the swagger leaves undescribed.

=head2 uid

Undocumented upstream. A C<uint32>; the swagger's example is C<1000>.
Serialised as C<UID> -- spelled out, because deriving it from the Perl name
would produce C<Uid>.

=head2 gid

Undocumented upstream. A C<uint32> too, C<1000> in the same example.
Serialised as C<GID> -- spelled out, because deriving it from the Perl name
would produce C<Gid>.
