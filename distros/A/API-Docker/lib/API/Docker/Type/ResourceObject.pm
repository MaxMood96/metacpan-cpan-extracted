=head1 NAME

API::Docker::Type::ResourceObject - An object describing the resources which can be advertised by a node and requested by a task

=head1 VERSION

version 0.004

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Generated from the C<ResourceObject> definition of C<spec/v1.51.yaml>.

=head2 nano_cpus

Undocumented upstream. The same units and the same example as
L<API::Docker::Type::Limit/nano_cpus>: C<4000000000> is four whole CPUs.
Serialised as C<NanoCPUs> -- spelled out, because deriving it from the Perl
name would produce C<NanoCpus>.

=head2 memory_bytes

Undocumented upstream. Bytes, and the same example as
L<API::Docker::Type::Limit/memory_bytes>.

=head2 generic_resources

User-defined resources can be either Integer resources (e.g, C<SSD=3>) or
String resources (e.g, C<GPU=UUID1>). See
L<API::Docker::Type::GenericResource>.
