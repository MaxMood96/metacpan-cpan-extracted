=head1 NAME

API::Docker::Type::Swarm - The body of the C<200> response to C<GET /swarm>

=head1 VERSION

version 0.004

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Generated from the C<Swarm> definition of C<spec/v1.51.yaml>, which the
swagger leaves undescribed. C<paths:> says what it is: the body of the
C<200> response to C<GET /swarm>, which is C<allOf [ $ref ClusterInfo, { 1
properties } ]>. The reference becomes a superclass, so a C<Swarm> carries
the 10 fields of L<API::Docker::Type::ClusterInfo> as well as the 1 declared
here -- 11 in all. See L<API::Docker::Type/C<allOf> becomes inheritance>.

=head2 join_tokens

JoinTokens contains the tokens workers and managers need to join the swarm.
See L<API::Docker::Type::JoinTokens>.
