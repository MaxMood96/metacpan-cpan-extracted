API::Docker::Type::ContainerNetworkStats - Aggregates the network stats of one container

=head1 VERSION

version 0.004

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Generated from the C<ContainerNetworkStats> definition of
C<spec/v1.51.yaml>.

=head2 rx_bytes

Bytes received. Windows and Linux. Serialised as C<rx_bytes> -- spelled out,
because deriving it from the Perl name would produce C<RxBytes>.

=head2 rx_packets

Packets received. Windows and Linux. Serialised as C<rx_packets> -- spelled
out, because deriving it from the Perl name would produce C<RxPackets>.

=head2 rx_errors

Received errors. Not used on Windows.

This field is Linux-specific and always zero for Windows containers.
Serialised as C<rx_errors> -- spelled out, because deriving it from the Perl
name would produce C<RxErrors>.

=head2 rx_dropped

Incoming packets dropped. Windows and Linux. Serialised as C<rx_dropped> --
spelled out, because deriving it from the Perl name would produce
C<RxDropped>.

=head2 tx_bytes

Bytes sent. Windows and Linux. Serialised as C<tx_bytes> -- spelled out,
because deriving it from the Perl name would produce C<TxBytes>.

=head2 tx_packets

Packets sent. Windows and Linux. Serialised as C<tx_packets> -- spelled out,
because deriving it from the Perl name would produce C<TxPackets>.

=head2 tx_errors

Sent errors. Not used on Windows.

This field is Linux-specific and always zero for Windows containers.
Serialised as C<tx_errors> -- spelled out, because deriving it from the Perl
name would produce C<TxErrors>.

=head2 tx_dropped

Outgoing packets dropped. Windows and Linux. Serialised as C<tx_dropped> --
spelled out, because deriving it from the Perl name would produce
C<TxDropped>.

=head2 endpoint_id

Endpoint ID. Not used on Linux.

This field is Windows-specific and omitted for Linux containers. Serialised
as C<endpoint_id> -- spelled out, because deriving it from the Perl name
would produce C<EndpointId>.

=head2 instance_id

Instance ID. Not used on Linux.

This field is Windows-specific and omitted for Linux containers. Serialised
as C<instance_id> -- spelled out, because deriving it from the Perl name
would produce C<InstanceId>.
