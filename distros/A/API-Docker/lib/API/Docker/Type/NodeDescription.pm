=head1 NAME

API::Docker::Type::NodeDescription - NodeDescription encapsulates the properties of the Node as reported by the agent

=head1 VERSION

version 0.004

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Generated from the C<NodeDescription> definition of C<spec/v1.51.yaml>.

=head2 hostname

Undocumented upstream. The node's hostname, C<bf3067039e47> in the swagger's
example. As the definition above says, it is what the agent reports, not
what a manager was told.

=head2 platform

Platform represents the platform (Arch/OS). See
L<API::Docker::Type::Platform>.

=head2 resources

An object describing the resources which can be advertised by a node and
requested by a task. See L<API::Docker::Type::ResourceObject>.

=head2 engine

EngineDescription provides information about an engine. See
L<API::Docker::Type::EngineDescription>.

=head2 tls_info

Information about the issuer of leaf TLS certificates and the trusted root
CA certificate. See L<API::Docker::Type::TLSInfo>. Serialised as C<TLSInfo>
-- spelled out, because deriving it from the Perl name would produce
C<TlsInfo>.
