version 0.004

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Generated from the C<ErrorResponse> definition of C<spec/v1.51.yaml>.

=head2 message

The error message. Serialised as C<message> -- spelled out, because deriving
it from the Perl name would produce C<Message>. The swagger lists this field
as required; nothing here enforces that, see L<API::Docker::Type/C<since> is
documentation>.
