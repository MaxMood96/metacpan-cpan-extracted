=head1 NAME

API::Docker::Type::ServiceSpec::UpdateConfig - Specification for the update strategy of the service

=head1 VERSION

version 0.004

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Generated from the inline C<UpdateConfig> schema of the C<ServiceSpec>
definition in C<spec/v1.51.yaml>.

=head2 parallelism

Maximum number of tasks to be updated in one iteration (0 means unlimited
parallelism).

=head2 delay

Amount of time between updates, in nanoseconds.

=head2 failure_action

Action to take if an updated task fails to run, or stops running during the
update. The swagger enumerates C<continue>, C<pause> and C<rollback>.

=head2 monitor

Amount of time to monitor each updated task for failures, in nanoseconds.

=head2 max_failure_ratio

The fraction of tasks that may fail during an update before the failure
action is invoked, specified as a floating point number between 0 and 1. The
daemon defaults it to 0.

=head2 order

The order of operations when rolling out an updated task. Either the old
task is shut down before the new task is started, or the new task is started
before the old task is shut down. The swagger enumerates C<stop-first> and
C<start-first>.
