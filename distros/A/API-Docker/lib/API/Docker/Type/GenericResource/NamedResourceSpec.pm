=head1 NAME

API::Docker::Type::GenericResource::NamedResourceSpec - A string-valued user-defined resource

=head1 VERSION

version 0.004

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Generated from the inline C<NamedResourceSpec> schema of the
C<GenericResources> definition in C<spec/v1.51.yaml>, which the swagger
leaves undescribed. The C<Kind>/C<Value> pair for a named resource,
C<GPU=UUID1> in the swagger's example.

=head2 kind

Undocumented upstream. The resource's name, C<GPU> in that example.

=head2 value

Undocumented upstream. The name of the one unit, C<UUID1> in that example.
The example carries two such objects, C<UUID1> and C<UUID2>, rather than one
object listing both -- a node advertising two GPUs advertises two entries.
