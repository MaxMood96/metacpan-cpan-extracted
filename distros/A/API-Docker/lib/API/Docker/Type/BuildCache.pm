=head1 NAME

API::Docker::Type::BuildCache - Information about a build cache record

=head1 VERSION

version 0.004

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Generated from the C<BuildCache> definition of C<spec/v1.51.yaml>.

=head2 id

Unique ID of the build cache record. Serialised as C<ID> -- spelled out,
because deriving it from the Perl name would produce C<Id>.

=head2 parents

List of parent build cache record IDs.

=head2 type

Cache record type. The swagger enumerates C<internal>, C<frontend>,
C<source.local>, C<source.git.checkout>, C<exec.cachemount> and C<regular>.

=head2 description

Description of the build-step that produced the build cache.

=head2 in_use

Indicates if the build cache is in use.

=head2 shared

Indicates if the build cache is shared.

=head2 size

Amount of disk space used by the build cache (in bytes).

=head2 created_at

Date and time at which the build cache was created in L<RFC
3339|https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt> format with nano-seconds.

=head2 last_used_at

Date and time at which the build cache was last used in L<RFC
3339|https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt> format with nano-seconds.

=head2 usage_count

Undocumented upstream. A count of uses, C<26> in the swagger's example. The
record's two other usage fields, L</in_use> and L</last_used_at>, are
described upstream; this one is not.
