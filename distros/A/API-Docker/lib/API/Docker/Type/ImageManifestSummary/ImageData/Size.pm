=head1 NAME

API::Docker::Type::ImageManifestSummary::ImageData::Size - The unpacked size of an image manifest

=head1 VERSION

version 0.004

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Generated from the inline C<Size> schema of
C<ImageManifestSummary.ImageData> in C<spec/v1.51.yaml>, which the swagger
leaves undescribed. One byte count, C<Unpacked>.

=head2 unpacked

Unpacked is the size (in bytes) of the locally unpacked (uncompressed) image
content that's directly usable by the containers running this image. It's
independent of the distributable content - e.g. the image might still have
an unpacked data that's still used by some container even when the
distributable/compressed content is already gone.
