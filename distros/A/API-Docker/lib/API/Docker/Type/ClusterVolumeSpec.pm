=head1 NAME

API::Docker::Type::ClusterVolumeSpec - Cluster-specific options used to create the volume

=head1 VERSION

version 0.004

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Generated from the C<ClusterVolumeSpec> definition of C<spec/v1.51.yaml>.

=head2 group

Group defines the volume group of this volume. Volumes belonging to the same
group can be referred to by group name when creating Services. Referring to
a volume by group instructs Swarm to treat volumes in that group
interchangeably for the purpose of scheduling. Volumes with an empty string
for a group technically all belong to the same, emptystring group.

=head2 access_mode

Defines how the volume is used by tasks. See
L<API::Docker::Type::ClusterVolumeSpec::AccessMode>.
