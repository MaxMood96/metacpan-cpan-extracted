=head1 NAME

API::Docker::Type::SystemVersion - Response of Engine API: GET "/version"

=head1 VERSION

version 0.004

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Generated from the C<SystemVersion> definition of C<spec/v1.51.yaml>.

=head2 platform

Undocumented upstream. One field, a name the engine gives itself. What the
two engines put in it has nothing in common; see
L<API::Docker::Type::SystemVersion::Platform/name>. See
L<API::Docker::Type::SystemVersion::Platform>.

=head2 components

Information about system components. See
L<API::Docker::Type::SystemVersion::Component>.

=head2 version

The version of the daemon.

=head2 api_version

The default (and highest) API version that is supported by the daemon.

=head2 min_api_version

The minimum API version that is supported by the daemon. Serialised as
C<MinAPIVersion> -- spelled out, because deriving it from the Perl name
would produce C<MinApiVersion>.

=head2 git_commit

The Git commit of the source code that was used to build the daemon.

=head2 go_version

The version Go used to compile the daemon, and the version of the Go runtime
in use.

=head2 os

The operating system that the daemon is running on ("linux" or "windows").

=head2 arch

Architecture of the daemon, as returned by the Go runtime (C<GOARCH>).

A full list of possible values can be found in the L<Go
documentation|https://go.dev/doc/install/source#environment>.

=head2 kernel_version

The kernel version (C<uname -r>) that the daemon is running on.

This field is omitted when empty.

=head2 experimental

Indicates if the daemon is started with experimental features enabled.

This field is omitted when empty / false.

=head2 build_time

The date and time that the daemon was compiled.
