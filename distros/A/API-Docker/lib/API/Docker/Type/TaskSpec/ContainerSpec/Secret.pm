=head1 NAME

API::Docker::Type::TaskSpec::ContainerSpec::Secret - One entry of C<TaskSpec.ContainerSpec.Secrets>

=head1 VERSION

version 0.004

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Generated from the inline C<items> schema of
C<TaskSpec.ContainerSpec.Secrets> in C<spec/v1.51.yaml>, which the swagger
leaves undescribed.

=head2 file

File represents a specific target that is backed by a file. See
L<API::Docker::Type::TaskSpec::ContainerSpec::Secret::File>.

=head2 secret_id

SecretID represents the ID of the specific secret that we're referencing.
Serialised as C<SecretID> -- spelled out, because deriving it from the Perl
name would produce C<SecretId>.

=head2 secret_name

SecretName is the name of the secret that this references, but this is just
provided for lookup/display purposes. The secret in the reference will be
identified by its ID.
