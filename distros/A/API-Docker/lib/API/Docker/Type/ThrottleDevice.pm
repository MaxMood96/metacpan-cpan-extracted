=head1 NAME

API::Docker::Type::ThrottleDevice - A per-device block IO rate limit

=head1 VERSION

version 0.004

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Generated from the C<ThrottleDevice> definition of C<spec/v1.51.yaml>, which
the swagger leaves undescribed. Nothing in C<paths:> reaches it either; it
is one entry of C<Resources.BlkioDeviceReadBps>,
C<Resources.BlkioDeviceReadIOps>, C<Resources.BlkioDeviceWriteBps> and
C<Resources.BlkioDeviceWriteIOps>.

=head2 path

Device path.

=head2 rate

Rate. What it counts depends on the field this device sits in: bytes per
second under C<blkio_device_read_bps> and C<blkio_device_write_bps>, IO
operations per second under C<blkio_device_read_iops> and
C<blkio_device_write_iops>.
