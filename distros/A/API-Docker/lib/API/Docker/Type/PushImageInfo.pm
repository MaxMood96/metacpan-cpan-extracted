=head1 NAME

API::Docker::Type::PushImageInfo - One event of the stream a C<POST /images/{name}/push> answers with

=head1 VERSION

version 0.004

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Generated from the C<PushImageInfo> definition of C<spec/v1.51.yaml>, which
the swagger leaves undescribed. The push progress stream, the same shape as
a pull's. A failed push is C<200> with an C<errorDetail> event, so the
status line is not the verdict.

=head2 error

Errors encountered during the operation.

> B<Deprecated>: This field is deprecated since API v1.4, and will be
omitted in a future API version. Use the information in errorDetail instead.
Serialised as C<error> -- spelled out, because deriving it from the Perl
name would produce C<Error>.

=head2 error_detail

Undocumented upstream. The failure, structured; the C<error> field beside it
carries the same text and the swagger deprecates it in favour of this one.
See L<API::Docker::Error::Stream>. See L<API::Docker::Type::ErrorDetail>.
Serialised as C<errorDetail> -- spelled out, because deriving it from the
Perl name would produce C<ErrorDetail>.

=head2 status

Undocumented upstream. The phase line, the same shape a pull's
L<API::Docker::Type::CreateImageInfo/status> carries. No push stream is
captured under F<t/fixtures/> -- pushing publishes to a real registry, so
this distribution does not run one. Serialised as C<status> -- spelled out,
because deriving it from the Perl name would produce C<Status>.

=head2 progress

Progress is a pre-formatted presentation of progressDetail.

> B<Deprecated>: This field is deprecated since API v1.8, and will be
omitted in a future API version. Use the information in progressDetail
instead. Serialised as C<progress> -- spelled out, because deriving it from
the Perl name would produce C<Progress>.

=head2 progress_detail

Undocumented upstream. The numbers behind L</progress>, which the swagger
describes as a pre-formatted presentation of this field. See
L<API::Docker::Type::ProgressDetail>. Serialised as C<progressDetail> --
spelled out, because deriving it from the Perl name would produce
C<ProgressDetail>.
