=head1 NAME

API::Docker::Type::Resources::Ulimit - One resource limit to set in a container

=head1 VERSION

version 0.004

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Generated from the inline C<items> schema of C<Resources.Ulimits> in
C<spec/v1.51.yaml>, which the swagger leaves undescribed. Upstream the
schema has no name at all: the class name is this one place where the model
does not follow from the spec mechanically, because C<Ulimits> had to be
made singular by hand. The mapping is recorded in
C<maint/spec-drift-exceptions.yaml>.

=head2 name

Name of ulimit. C<nofile> for instance.

=head2 soft

Soft limit.

=head2 hard

Hard limit.
