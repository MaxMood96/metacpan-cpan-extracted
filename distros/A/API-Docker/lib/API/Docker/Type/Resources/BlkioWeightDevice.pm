=head1 NAME

API::Docker::Type::Resources::BlkioWeightDevice - A per-device block IO weight

=head1 VERSION

version 0.004

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Generated from the inline C<items> schema of C<Resources.BlkioWeightDevice>
in C<spec/v1.51.yaml>, which the swagger leaves undescribed. Neither the
schema nor its two fields carry a description upstream; the form the swagger
shows for the enclosing field is C<< [{"Path": "device_path", "Weight":
weight}] >>.

=head2 path

Undocumented upstream. The device path, per the swagger's example form.

=head2 weight

Undocumented upstream. The relative weight for that device; the swagger
constrains it to 0 or above and nothing else.
