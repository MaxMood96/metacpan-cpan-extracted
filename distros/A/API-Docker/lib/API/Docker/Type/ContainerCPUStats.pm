=head1 NAME

API::Docker::Type::ContainerCPUStats - CPU related info of the container

=head1 VERSION

version 0.004

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Generated from the C<ContainerCPUStats> definition of C<spec/v1.51.yaml>.

=head2 cpu_usage

All CPU stats aggregated since container inception. See
L<API::Docker::Type::ContainerCPUUsage>. Serialised as C<cpu_usage> --
spelled out, because deriving it from the Perl name would produce
C<CpuUsage>.

=head2 system_cpu_usage

System Usage.

This field is Linux-specific and omitted for Windows containers. Serialised
as C<system_cpu_usage> -- spelled out, because deriving it from the Perl
name would produce C<SystemCpuUsage>.

=head2 online_cpus

Number of online CPUs.

This field is Linux-specific and omitted for Windows containers. Serialised
as C<online_cpus> -- spelled out, because deriving it from the Perl name
would produce C<OnlineCpus>.

=head2 throttling_data

CPU throttling stats of the container. See
L<API::Docker::Type::ContainerThrottlingData>. Serialised as
C<throttling_data> -- spelled out, because deriving it from the Perl name
would produce C<ThrottlingData>.
