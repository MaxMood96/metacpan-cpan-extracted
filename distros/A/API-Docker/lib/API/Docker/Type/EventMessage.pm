=head1 NAME

API::Docker::Type::EventMessage - The information an event contains

=head1 VERSION

version 0.004

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Generated from the C<EventMessage> definition of C<spec/v1.51.yaml>.

=head2 type

The type of object emitting the event. The swagger enumerates C<builder>,
C<config>, C<container>, C<daemon>, C<image>, C<network>, C<node>,
C<plugin>, C<secret>, C<service> and C<volume>.

=head2 action

The type of event.

=head2 actor

Actor describes something that generates events, like a container, network,
or a volume. See L<API::Docker::Type::EventActor>.

=head2 scope

Scope of the event. Engine events are C<local> scope. Cluster (Swarm) events
are C<swarm> scope. Serialised as C<scope> -- spelled out, because deriving
it from the Perl name would produce C<Scope>.

=head2 time

Timestamp of event. Serialised as C<time> -- spelled out, because deriving
it from the Perl name would produce C<Time>.

=head2 time_nano

Timestamp of event, with nanosecond accuracy. Serialised as C<timeNano> --
spelled out, because deriving it from the Perl name would produce
C<TimeNano>.
