=head1 NAME

API::Docker::Type::IndexInfo - Information about a registry

=head1 VERSION

version 0.004

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Generated from the C<IndexInfo> definition of C<spec/v1.51.yaml>.

=head2 name

Name of the registry, such as "docker.io".

=head2 mirrors

List of mirrors, expressed as URIs.

=head2 secure

Indicates if the registry is part of the list of insecure registries.

If C<false>, the registry is insecure. Insecure registries accept
un-encrypted (HTTP) and/or untrusted (HTTPS with certificates from unknown
CAs) communication.

> B<Warning>: Insecure registries can be useful when running a local >
registry. However, because its use creates security vulnerabilities > it
should ONLY be enabled for testing purposes. For increased > security, users
should add their CA to their system's list of > trusted CAs instead of
enabling this option.

=head2 official

Indicates whether this is an official registry (i.e., Docker Hub /
docker.io).
