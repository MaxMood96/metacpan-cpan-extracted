=head1 OPTIONS

C<*> marks required options.

=head2 Main options

=over

=item B<--resize>=I<s>*

Resize instruction, follows ImageMagick format.

Resize instruction can be given in several formats:

 Syntax                     Meaning
 -------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------
 ""                         No resizing.
 
 SCALE"%"                   Height and width both scaled by specified percentage.
 SCALEX"%x"SCALEY"%"        Height and width individually scaled by specified percentages. (Only one % symbol needed.)
 
 WIDTH                      Width given, height automagically selected to preserve aspect ratio.
 WIDTH">"                   Shrink width if larger, height automagically selected to preserve aspect ratio.
 WIDTH"^"                   Enlarge width if smaller, height automagically selected to preserve aspect ratio.
 
 "x"HEIGHT                  Height given, width automagically selected to preserve aspect ratio.
 "x"HEIGHT">"               Shrink height if larger, width automagically selected to preserve aspect ratio.
 "x"HEIGHT"^"               Enlarge height if smaller, width automagically selected to preserve aspect ratio.
 
 WIDTH"x"HEIGHT             Maximum values of height and width given, aspect ratio preserved.
 WIDTH"x"HEIGHT"^"          Minimum values of height and width given, aspect ratio preserved.
 WIDTH"x"HEIGHT"!"          Width and height emphatically given, original aspect ratio ignored.
 WIDTH"x"HEIGHT">"          Shrinks an image with dimension(s) larger than the corresponding width and/or height argument(s).
 WIDTH"x"HEIGHT"<"          Shrinks an image with dimension(s) larger than the corresponding width and/or height argument(s).
 
 NUMBER"^>"                 Shrink shortest side if larger than number, aspect ratio preserved.
 NUMBER"^<"                 Enlarge shortest side if larger than number, aspect ratio preserved.
 "^"NUMBER">"               Shrink longer side if larger than number, aspect ratio preserved.
 "^"NUMBER"<"               Enlarge longer side if larger than number, aspect ratio preserved.

Currently unsupported:

 AREA"@"                    Resize image to have specified area in pixels. Aspect ratio is preserved.
 X":"Y                      Here x and y denotes an aspect ratio (e.g. 3:2 = 1.5).

Ref: L<http://www.imagemagick.org/script/command-line-processing.php#geometry>


Can also be specified as the 2nd command-line argument.

=item B<--size>=I<s>*

Image/video size, in <width>x<height> format, e.g. 2592x1944.

Can also be specified as the 1st command-line argument.

=back

=head2 Output options

=over

=item B<--format>=I<s>

Choose output format, e.g. json, text.

Default value:

 undef

Output can be displayed in multiple formats, and a suitable default format is
chosen depending on the application and/or whether output destination is
interactive terminal (i.e. whether output is piped). This option specifically
chooses an output format.


=item B<--json>

Set output format to json.

=item B<--naked-res>

When outputing as JSON, strip result envelope.

Default value:

 0

By default, when outputing as JSON, the full enveloped result is returned, e.g.:

 [200,"OK",[1,2,3],{"func.extra"=>4}]

The reason is so you can get the status (1st element), status message (2nd
element) as well as result metadata/extra result (4th element) instead of just
the result (3rd element). However, sometimes you want just the result, e.g. when
you want to pipe the result for more post-processing. In this case you can use
C<--naked-res> so you just get:

 [1,2,3]


=item B<--page-result>

Filter output through a pager.

This option will pipe the output to a specified pager program. If pager program
is not specified, a suitable default e.g. C<less> is chosen.


=item B<--view-result>

View output using a viewer.

This option will first save the output to a temporary file, then open a viewer
program to view the temporary file. If a viewer program is not chosen, a
suitable default, e.g. the browser, is chosen.


=back

=head2 Other options

=over

=item B<--help>, B<-h>, B<-?>

Display help message and exit.

=item B<--version>, B<-v>

Display program's version and exit.

=back

=head1 COMPLETION

This script has shell tab completion capability with support for several
shells.

=head2 bash

To activate bash completion for this script, put:

 complete -C calc-image-resized-size calc-image-resized-size

in your bash startup (e.g. F<~/.bashrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is recommended, however, that you install modules using L<cpanm-shcompgen>
which can activate shell completion for scripts immediately.

=head2 tcsh

To activate tcsh completion for this script, put:

 complete calc-image-resized-size 'p/*/`calc-image-resized-size`/'

in your tcsh startup (e.g. F<~/.tcshrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is also recommended to install L<shcompgen> (see above).

=head2 other shells

For fish and zsh, install L<shcompgen> as described above.

Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You can
simply modify the code, then test via:

 % prove -l

If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally on your
system), you can install L<Dist::Zilla>,
L<Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR>,
L<Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR>, and sometimes one or two other
Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps required beyond
that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
