NAME
    App::ThisDist - Print Perl {distribution,module,author,...} associated
    with current directory

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.024 of App::ThisDist (from Perl
    distribution App-ThisDist), released on 2024-12-21.

DESCRIPTION
    See included scripts:

    *   this-dist

    *   this-mod

FUNCTIONS
  this_dist
    Usage:

     my $dist = this_dist([ $dir ] [ , $extract_version? ] [ , $detail? ]); => e.g. "App-Foo" or "App-Foo 1.23" or {dist=>"App-Foo", dist_version=>1.23, ...}

    If $dir is not specified, will default to current directory. If
    $extract_version is set to true, will also try to extract distribution
    version and will return "?" for version when version cannot be found. If
    $detail is set to true, then instead of just a string, will return a
    hash of more detailed information.

    Debugging statement are logged using Log::ger.

  this_mod
    A thin wrapper for "this_dist". It just converts "-" in the result to
    "::", so "Foo-Bar" becomes "Foo::Bar".

    Debugging statement are logged using Log::ger.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
