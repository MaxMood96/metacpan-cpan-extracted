=head1 NAME

cdtarget-backend - Change directory to symlink target's directory

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.010 of cdtarget-backend (from Perl distribution App-CdUtils), released on 2025-09-23.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

To use in shell:

 % cdtarget() { cd `cdtarget-backend "$1"`; }

 % pwd
 /tmp

 % file p1todo p2
 p1todo: symbolic link to /home/u1/Documents/project1/todo.txt
 p2: symbolic link to /home/u1/Documents/project2

 % cdtarget p1todo

 % pwd
 /home/u1/Documents/project1

 % cdtarget p2

 % pwd
 /home/u1/Documents/project2

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<cdtarget> is a command to change directory to a symlink target's directory. If
the target is already a directory then it will be used directly, otherwise it's
the target's directory that is used.

If symlink is not specified as argument, and there is a single symlink in the
current directory and nothing else, that symlink will be used.

=head1 CONTRIBUTING


To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull requests on
GitHub.

Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You can
simply modify the code, then test via:

 % prove -l

If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally on your
system), you can install L<Dist::Zilla>,
L<Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR>,
L<Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR>, and sometimes one or two other
Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps required beyond
that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.

=head1 BUGS

Please report any bugs or feature requests on the bugtracker website L<https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Dist/Display.html?Name=App-CdUtils>

When submitting a bug or request, please include a test-file or a
patch to an existing test-file that illustrates the bug or desired
feature.
