        {
            base_upload_cmd => [qw(rsync -a -v --progress --inplace)],
            dest_upload_prefix => 'hostgator:public_html/',
            dest_upload_url_prefix => 'http://www.shlomifish.org/',
        }
    );

=head2 $sky->dest_upload_url_prefix

The base URL where the uploads will be found.

=head2 my $results = $sky->get_upload_results({ filenames => ["Shine4U.webm"], target_dir => "Files/files/video/" });
