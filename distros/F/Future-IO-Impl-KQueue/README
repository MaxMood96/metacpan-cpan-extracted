NAME

    Future::IO::Impl::KQueue - implement Future::IO using kqueue(2)

DESCRIPTION

    This module provides an implementation for Future::IO which uses the
    kqueue(2) and kevents(2) system calls, via IO::KQueue.

    There are no additional methods to use in this module; it simply has to
    be loaded, and it will provide the Future::IO implementation methods:

       use Future::IO;
       use Future::IO::Impl::KQueue;
    
       my $f = Future::IO->sleep(5);
       ...
