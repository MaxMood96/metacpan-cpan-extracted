         }

    *   Example #6:

         extract_timestamp_from_filename(filename => "foo.txt"); # -> 0

    *Handling of timezone.* If timestmap contains timezone indication, e.g.
    +0700, will return "tz_offset" key in the result hash as well as
    "epoch". Otherwise, will return "tz" key in the result hash with the
    value of "floating" and "epoch_local" calculated using Time::Local's
    "timelocal_posix" as well as "epoch_utc" calculated using
    "timegm_posix".

    This function is not exported by default, but exportable.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   all => *bool*

        Find all timestamps instead of the first found only.

        Not yet implemented.

    *   filename* => *str*

        (No description)

    Return value: (bool|hash)

    Return false if no timestamp is detected. Otherwise return a hash of
    information, which contains these keys: "epoch", "year", "month", "day",
    "hour", "minute", "second".

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
