NAME
    GitHub::Config::SSH::UserData - Read user data from comments in ssh
    config file

VERSION
    Version 0.08

SYNOPSIS
       use GitHub::Config::SSH::UserData qw(get_user_data_from_ssh_cfg);

       my $udata = get_user_data_from_ssh_cfg("johndoe");

    or

       my $udata = get_user_data_from_ssh_cfg("johndoe", $my_ssh_config_file);

DESCRIPTION
    This module exports a single function ("get_user_data_from_ssh_cfg()")
    that is useful when using multiple GitHub accounts with SSH keys. First,
    you should read this gist
    <https://gist.github.com/oanhnn/80a89405ab9023894df7> and follow the
    instructions.

    To use "get_user_data_from_ssh_cfg()", you must add information to your
    ssh config file (default ~/.ssh/config) by adding comments like this:

      Host github-ALL-ITEMS
      #  User: John Doe <main@addr.xy> <foo@bar> additional data
         HostName github.com
         IdentityFile ~/.ssh/abc
         IdentitiesOnly yes

      Host github-minimal
      #  User: <main@addr.xy>
         HostName github.com
         IdentityFile ~/.ssh/mini
         IdentitiesOnly yes

      Host github-std
      #  User: Jonny Controlletti <main-jc@addr.xy>
         HostName github.com
         IdentityFile ~/.ssh/std
         IdentitiesOnly yes

      Host github-std-data
      #  User: Alexander Platz <AlexPl@addr.xy> more data
         HostName github.com
         IdentityFile ~/.ssh/aaaaa
         IdentitiesOnly yes

    The function looks for "Host" names beginning with "github-". It assumes
    that the part after the hyphen is your username on github. E.g., in the
    example above the github usernames are "ALL-ITEMS", "minimal", "std" and
    "std-data".

    The next line must be a comment line beginning with "User:" followed by
    an optional name (full name, may contain spaces) followed by one or two
    email addresses in angle brackets, optionally followed by another
    string. See the examples above.

    The following function can be exported on demand:

    "get_user_data_from_ssh_cfg(*USER_NAME*, *SSH_CFG_FILE*)"
    "get_user_data_from_ssh_cfg(*USER_NAME*)"
        The function scans file *"SSH_CFG_FILE"* (default is
        "$ENV{HOME}/.ssh/config" and looks for "Host github-*USER_NAME*".
        Then is scans the "User:" comment in the next line (see description
        above). It returns a reference to a hash containing:

        "full_name"
            The full name before the first email address. If no full name is
            specified, then the value is set to *"USER_NAME"*.

            This key always exists.

        "email"
            The first email address. This key always exists.

        "email2"
            The second email address. This key only exists if a second email
            address is specified.

        "other_data"
            Trailing string. This key only exists if a second email address
            if there is such a trailing string.

        If "Host github-*USER_NAME*" is not found, or if there is no
        corresponding "User:" comment, or if this comment is not formatted
        correctly, a fatal error occurs.
