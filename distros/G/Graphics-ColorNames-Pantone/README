NAME
    Graphics::ColorNames::Pantone - RGB values of Pantone colors

SYNOPSIS
      require Graphics::ColorNames::Pantone;

      $NameTable = Graphics::ColorNames::Pantone->NamesRgbTable();

DESCRIPTION
    See the documentation of Graphics::ColorNames for information how to use
    this module.

    This module defines 1091 names and associated RGB values of colors which
    are part of a palette created by the *Pantone Institute* for Designers.
    Please not mistake them for the colors of the annual *Pantone Report*.
    To access them use Graphics::ColorNames::PantoneReport.

    Pantone names are numbers with three or four digits. Colors from the
    extended palette are marked by an appended *'2x'* (without space) (e.g.
    "8082x" ).
