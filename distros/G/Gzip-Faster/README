This is the README for Gzip::Faster version 0.22.

Gzip::Faster is a "module" for the Perl computer programming language, a
library of computer code to install on a computer.  This document contains
four sections:

1. About - what the module does

2. Documentation - how to learn more about the module

3. Installation - how to install this module on a computer

4. Help - what to do if you get stuck

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. ABOUT

Gzip::Faster - simple and fast gzip and gunzip

This module compresses to and decompresses from the gzip and related
formats. See "About gzip" if you aren't familiar with the gzip
format.

The basic functions of the module are "gzip" and "gunzip", which
convert scalars to and from gzip format. There are also three
convenience functions built on these two: "gzip_file" reads a file
then compresses it; "gunzip_file" reads a file then uncompresses it;
and "gzip_to_file" compresses a scalar and writes it to a file.

Further to this, "deflate" and "inflate" work with the "deflate
format", which is the same as the gzip format except it has no header
information. "deflate_raw" and "inflate_raw" work with the
bare-bones version of this format without checksums.

If you need to control the compression beyond what is offered by
"gzip" and "gunzip", create a Gzip::Faster object using "new",
and compress and uncompress using the "zip" and "unzip"
methods. The type of compression can be toggled with "gzip_format"
and "raw". A file name can be set and retrieved from the gzip header
with "file_name", and the modification time of the file can be set
and retrieved with "mod_time". The level of compression can be
altered with "level". Perl flags can be copied into the gzip header
using "copy_perl_flags".

2. DOCUMENTATION

You can read the documentation for the module online at the following
website:

    * http://metacpan.org/release/Gzip-Faster

(This link goes to the latest version of the module.)

After installing the module, you can read the documentation on your
computer using

    perldoc Gzip::Faster

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. INSTALLATION

This module requires Perl version 5.8.1 or later.

To install the module from CPAN, use

    cpan Gzip::Faster

If you have the App::cpanminus installer, you may prefer

    cpanm Gzip::Faster

To install the module from the source file, Gzip-Faster-0.22.tar.gz, follow
this sequence of commands:

    tar xfz Gzip-Faster-0.22.tar.gz
    cd Gzip-Faster-0.22
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install

If you want to test the module before installing it, use "make test" after
"make" and before "make install".

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

module, you can report a bug at 

<https://github.com/benkasminbullock/gzip-faster/issues>,
