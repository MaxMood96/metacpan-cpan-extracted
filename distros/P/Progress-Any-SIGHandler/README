NAME
    Progress::Any::SIGHandler - Output progress to terminal as simple
    message

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.001 of Progress::Any::SIGHandler (from
    Perl distribution Progress-Any-SIGHandler), released on 2025-10-30.

SYNOPSIS
    Simplest way to use:

     use Progress::Any '$progress';
     use Progress::Any::SIGHandler;

     # do stuffs while updating progress
     $progress->target(10);
     for (1..10) {
         # do stuffs
         $progress->update;
     }
     $progress->finish;

    Customize some aspects:

     use Progress::Any::SIGHandler (
         template  => '...',      # default template is: "Progress: %P/%T (%6.2p%%), %R"
         signal    => 'USR2',     # default is USR1
     );

DESCRIPTION
    Importing this module will install a %SIG handler (the default is
    "USR1"). When your process is sent the signal, the handler will print to
    STDERR the progress report. You can customize some aspects (see
    Synopsis). More customization will be added in the future.

IMPORT ARGUMENTS
  signal
    See "$Signal".

  template
    See "$Template".

PACKAGE VARIABLES
  $Signal
    The Unix signal to use. Set it before call to install_sig_handler(). A
    convenient is to pass the `signal` argument during import, which will
    set this variable.

  $Template
    Template to use (see "fill_template" in Progress::Any documentation).

FUNCTIONS
  install_sig_handler
    Called automatically by import(), but if you do not import, you can
    invoke this explicitly yourself.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
