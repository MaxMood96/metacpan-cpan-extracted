<<<=== LEGAL OVERVIEW ===>>>

All Perl Community Family software, documentation, and creative data compilations are legally copyrighted by Perl Community.

To maintain the legal integrity and defensibility of the Perl Community Family of software, documentation, and creative data compilations, all contributors to the Perl Community Family must assign copyright ownership to Perl Community under the terms of the Perl Community Family Copyright Assignment Agreement above, thereby empowering us to pursue legal action against those who attempt to violate any Perl Community Family copyright, license, or other intellectual property rights.

This is the same strategy used by the Free Software Foundation for many GNU software projects, as explained below:

Why The FSF Gets Copyright Assignments From Contributors
By Professor Eben Moglen, Columbia University Law School
Copyright Â© 2001, 2013, 2014, 2017, 2022, 2025 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

"Under US copyright law, which is the law under which most free software programs have historically been first published, there are very substantial procedural advantages to registration of copyright.  And despite the broad right of distribution conveyed by the GPL, enforcement of copyright is generally not possible for distributors: only the copyright holder or someone having assignment of the copyright can enforce the license.  If there are multiple authors of a copyrighted work, successful enforcement depends on having the cooperation of all authors.

In order to make sure that all of our copyrights can meet the recordkeeping and other requirements of registration, and in order to be able to enforce the GPL most effectively, FSF requires that each author of code incorporated in FSF projects provide a copyright assignment, and, where appropriate, a disclaimer of any work-for-hire ownership claims by the programmer's employer.  That way we can be sure that all the code in FSF projects is free code, whose freedom we can most effectively protect, and therefore on which other developers can completely rely."


<<<=== COMMITMENT TO FREE & OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE ===>>>

Perl Community is committed to maintaining the free-and-open-source software (FOSS) basis of the Perl Community Family.

If your Perl Community Family contribution is accepted and merged into an official Perl Community Family source repository, then your contribution is automatically published online with FOSS licensing, such as the GNU GPL and/or Artistic licenses.

<<<=== EMPLOYER COPYRIGHT DISCLAIMER AGREEMENT ===>>>

The file named EMPLOYERS.pdf contains the Employer Copyright Disclaimer Agreement.  If you are employed or work as an independent contractor, and either your job involves the creation of software, documentation, or creative data compilations, or you have executed an agreement giving your employer or contractee rights to such creations, then we must receive a fully-executed copy of the EMPLOYERS agreement.  Please print the file on one page of paper, and use blue ink to clearly write the entity's full name and address, followed by your full legal name and the project to which you are contributing.  In the presence of an official Notary Public, have a vice president or general manager in your organization use blue ink to write the date, their own full legal name and organizational title, and sign their signature.  Then, have the Notary Public notarize the appropriate area at the bottom of the document.  You may submit the notarized and fully-executed EMPLOYERS document either in original paper form via snail mail (preferable), or a high-resolution digital scanned copy via e-mail.  


<<<=== OTHER CONTRIBUTORS ===>>>

If anyone other than yourself has contributed software, documentation, or creative data compilations as part of your Perl Community Family contribution, then they must submit their contributions themselves under the terms of the Perl Community Family Copyright Assignment Agreement above, and their respective employer(s) or contractee(s) must all sign and submit their own copies of the Employer Copyright Disclaimer Agreement.

Please be sure you DO NOT STUDY OR INCLUDE any 3rd-party or public-domain intellectual property as part of your Perl Community Family contribution, including but not limited to: source code; documentation; creative data compilations; copyrighted, trademarked, or patented components; or technical concepts.  In other words, don't copy someone else's work and don't study someone else's work while doing your own.  All your work must be 100% original.


<<<=== RECOGNITION ===>>>

Once we have received your contribution under the terms of the Perl Community Family Copyright Assignment Agreement above, as well as any necessary Employer Copyright Disclaimer Agreement(s), then we will begin the process of reviewing any software pull requests or merge requests you have submitted through the official Perl Community Family repositories.  Upon approval of said request(s), you should automatically be listed in the repository as one of the official Perl Community Contributors.


<<<=== SUBMISSION ===>>>

When you are ready to submit the signed Employer Copyright Disclaimer Agreement(s), please answer the following 12 questions about yourself and your Perl Community Family contribution, then include your answers in the body of your e-mail or on a separate sheet of paper in snail mail, and send it all to one of the addresses below.
