t/bump/003_bundles.data
- write the equivalent of each bundle,
  when features where "known" and unfeatures disabled

what about "use strict"

- if use strict, drop it after 5.12
- if no strict, keep it
- if nothing and no use v5.12, add no strict?

add specific test scripts for strict and warnings

double check what to do for unfeatures

use v5.10 implies:
switch*
indirect
multidimensional
bareword_filehandles
smartmatch
