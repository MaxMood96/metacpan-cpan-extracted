- add complete tests for all features
- add a test to check all features have tests
- add bump_safely tests for all features (easiest: same as bump)
- document the name "unfeatures"

# basic format for all tests:

use feature 'foo';
no warnings 'experimental::foo'

no feature 'foo';

use experimental 'foo';

feature compat
